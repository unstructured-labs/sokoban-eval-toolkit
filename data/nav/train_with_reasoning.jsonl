Why certain approaches fail: Going up ('U') or right ('R') adds unnecessary distance—e.g., 'U' requires extra 'D' later, lengthening path; excessive left ('LLL') hits left bound (col 1), requiring 'R' recovery. Staying minimal avoids bounds issues from center start. BFS-like mental search: Prioritize net displacement.

Key constraints: moves must stay within bounds (rows 1-6, columns 1-8); cannot go out of bounds. No obstacles block paths, making this an open-field navigation. Patterns: completely traversable grid, shortest path requires net movement of +4 rows (down) and +3 columns (right), total Manhattan distance 7 steps. Bounds act as implicit barriers.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple possible paths exist due to the open grid—any sequence of exactly 4 'D' (down) and 3 'R' (right) moves will reach the goal without exceeding bounds, as long as we don't go left/up unnecessarily. Total shortest paths follow binomial coefficient C(7,3)=35 variations. No paths are blocked by walls since none exist. No dead ends or traps, but potential issues arise from bounds: moving 'U' from row 1 or 'L' from column 1 goes out of bounds (invalid); excessive 'D' beyond row 6 or 'R' beyond column 8 also invalid, though not reachable in minimal paths. General direction: primarily down (4 steps) and right (3 steps); stay in the top-left to mid-right area to avoid unnecessary detours. Approaches that would fail: (1) Paths with 'U' or 'L' moves increase distance or risk bounds (e.g., starting with 'L' from (1,1) out of bounds); (2) Paths with extra moves (e.g., 'R' then 'L') are longer and inefficient; (3) Going too far down first to row 6 then trying to adjust wastes steps or risks bounds if overcorrecting; (4) In a walled grid, BFS/DFS would be needed, but here greedy right-then-down or down-then-right works. Chosen strategy: Move right first to column 4 (aligns horizontally early), then down to row 5—avoids bottom-bound risks and keeps path simple.

Dead-end avoidance: none needed, but if walls were at (5,1)-(5,3), this alternate would fail, teaching preference for horizontal alignment first in uncertain grids.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace of RRRDDDD:\n1.

Multiple paths exist (e.g., all left then down: LLDDDDD; interleave like L D L D D D D; all down then left: DDDDDLL). All are valid since no walls block any cell.\nBlocked paths: None, as no # walls. However, bounds act as soft constraints—e.g., cannot go left from column 1 or up from row 1, but our path doesn't require it.\nDead ends or traps: None in this open grid. In general mazes, dead ends are cul-de-sacs surrounded by walls; here, irrelevant. To avoid in future puzzles: use BFS to explore shortest paths without revisiting, or track visited cells.\nGeneral direction: Primarily down (net +5 rows), secondarily left (net -2 columns). Avoid unnecessary up/right to minimize steps, though possible (e.g., R then L cancels out, but wasteful).\nApproaches that would fail:\n- Going up (U) or right (R) excessively: e.g., 6 R hits column 6 then needs 8 L to compensate (to col1), longer path (14+ moves), but still reaches goal—fails efficiency, not solvability.\n- Overshooting bounds: e.g., from (3,1) trying L goes out-of-bounds (invalid move).\n- Wrong net displacement: e.g., only 4 D reaches row 7, misses goal.\nGeneric strategies extensible to other domains: Compute deltas (Δrow=5 down, Δcol=-2 left). Prioritize net moves matching deltas. In mazes, use A* with heuristic (Manhattan distance) to guide; here, heuristic=actual cost. Explore alternates via mental simulation or tree search. Avoid greedily hugging walls (irrelevant here). Test paths by forward simulation.

The player (@) starts at row 4, column 6. The goal (G) is at row 6, column 2. There are no walls (#) anywhere on the grid—all cells are empty (-), making the entire space fully traversable. Key variables: Δrow = +2 (down), Δcol = -4 (left), Manhattan distance = 6 moves. No obstacles, so no impassable cells. Patterns/constraints: open grid allows any path without collision risks, but must stay within bounds (rows 1-9, cols 1-12). Potential out-of-bounds risks if over-moving up/left from start or down/right near goal, but minimal here.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Need to net move down 2 (D twice) and left 4 (L four times) in any order for a shortest path of 6 moves. Multiple paths exist (e.g., all left then down: LLLLDD; interleaved like LLDLDL; all down then left: DDLLLL). All shortest paths work since no walls. No blocked paths. Dead ends/traps: None, as open grid—no loops or blocks to trap player. However, detours (e.g., going right/up first) create longer paths requiring backtracking (e.g., R then L cancels out, wasting moves). General direction: Primarily left (4 moves) and down (2 moves)—prioritize left to align column early, then down. Approaches that fail: (1) Moving only up/right (e.g., UURR) goes away from goal, hits bounds (row 1 or col 12), requires correction but succeeds eventually. (2) Over-left from col 2 (e.g., after reaching col 2, extra L to col 1 then must R back)—not minimal. (3) Ignoring bounds: From start, LLLLLL reaches col 0 (invalid). BFS/DFS mentally: Explore neighbors, no pruning needed. Generic strategy: Decompose into independent x/y moves when no obstacles (here, commute L/D). For obstructed grids, prioritize low-risk directions, avoid greedily shortest if traps exist.

Wall locations: (1,4), (3,5), (5,5), (6,4), (8,1), (9,3). \n\nKey patterns and constraints: The grid has sparse walls, mostly in upper rows blocking column 4 and 5 partially. Notably, column 4 has walls at row 1 and row 6, creating a barrier above the start, but open below. Bottom area has wall at (8,1) and (9,3), which could trap movement if approaching goal from left in row 9. Player and goal are aligned in the same column (4), only 2 rows apart. Direct vertical path down column 4 is unobstructed. No diagonal moves; only orthogonal. Moves must stay within bounds (rows 1-10, cols 1-6) and avoid # cells. Empty cells (-) and G are passable.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Shortest path is direct down (2 moves), as player and goal share column 4, and cells (8,4) and (9,4) are open (- and G). Multiple longer paths exist, e.g., right to col 5/6 then down and left, or left to col 2/3 navigating around (9,3) wall. \n\nBlocked paths: Cannot go up from start to (6,4) due to wall. Paths through upper maze (rows 1-6) are possible but circuitous and unnecessary, with walls at col5 rows 3/5 potentially creating zigzags. Dead ends/traps: From row 8, moving left to col 1 hits wall at (8,1); from row 9 left side, (9,3) wall blocks direct left-right crossing at row 9 col 3. If overshoot down to row 10 col 4, must backtrack up. \n\nGeneral direction: Primarily down (south), minimal lateral movement needed. \n\nApproaches that fail: 1) Upward exploration hits immediate wall at (6,4) and leads to complex upper maze without progress toward goal. 2) Aggressive left from row 8 col 4 to col 3, then down hits (9,3) wall, creating dead end requiring backtrack. 3) Right loops around but longer (e.g., R D L D = 4 moves vs 2). 4) Boundary violations, e.g., L L L from start to col1 row7, then left out of bounds invalid. Generic strategy: Prioritize Manhattan distance (here 2 down), check direct line for obstacles (clear), use BFS mentally for shortest path, identify chokepoints (col4 row6 wall forces down-only), avoid greedy traps by verifying endpoints.

Player starts at row 3, column 10 (@). Goal is at row 10, column 10 (G). There are NO walls (#) anywhere in the grid—all cells are empty (-), making this an open-field navigation puzzle with no impassable obstacles. Key positions: start (3,10), goal (10,10). Patterns/constraints: completely open space allows freedom of movement in four directions (U, D, L, R), but must stay within bounds (rows 1-12, columns 1-11). Moves out of bounds are invalid. Required net displacement: +7 rows down (from row 3 to 10), 0 columns horizontally. No barriers, so direct vertical path is possible, but bounds act as implicit boundaries.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Multiple possible paths exist due to open grid—any sequence netting +7 down and 0 horizontal displacement works, but shortest is 7 downs (Manhattan distance = 7). Paths blocked? None by walls, but bounds constrain: cannot go above row 1 (U from row 1 invalid), below row 12 (D from 12 invalid), left of col 1 (L from 1 invalid), right of col 11 (R from 11 invalid). Dead ends/traps: None structurally, but inefficient paths could trap in corners, e.g., going left to col 1 then down would require right moves later, lengthening path; going up to row 1 then down would waste moves. Going to row 12 overshoots goal, requiring backtrack up (not dead end but inefficient). General direction: Primarily down (7 net D), stay near column 10 to minimize horizontal detours. Approaches that fail: Pure left/right zigzags (no net down progress); upward exploration (increases distance to goal); overshooting to row 12 without backtracking (but backtracking possible in open grid). BFS/DFS mentally: Prioritize down-first for shortest path.

All other cells are empty ('-').\n\nKey constraints: Moves must stay within bounds (rows 1-10, columns 1-6). Walls are impassable. Net movement required: 8 rows down (D) and 2 columns left (L). The grid is mostly open space, with only two isolated walls. The wall at (1,2) is near the top-left and irrelevant for downward paths. The wall at (7,3) blocks a single cell in the middle-right during descent, potentially affecting paths moving left near row 7 in column 3. No full blockages or narrow corridors exist, but paths must avoid exactly these two cells. Patterns: Vertical and horizontal movement is free except at these points; columns 1,2,4,5,6 are fully traversable vertically, column 3 has a wall only at row 7 and row 1 col 2 affects only top.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Multiple paths exist due to open grid; shortest paths are 10 moves (8D + 2L in any order, avoiding walls).

Approaches that fail: Over-right bottom (RRU sequence dead-ends at (5,5) unable to progress up); ignoring bounds (e.g., LLL from start hits col1 wall indirectly via navigation); brute-force up-left (longer, risks top-left #). Why fail: Violate impassable # or bounds; no pathfinding lookahead. Generic strategies: Prioritize BFS-like exploration (check adjacent cells, enqueue valid moves); prefer shortest paths by minimizing steps; identify chokepoints (e.g., (4,5)# as right-side blocker); simulate alternates to prune dead ends; net vector (Δrow=-2, Δcol=+1) guides but verify obstacles.

Moving up (to rows 1-3) or left wastes moves, leading to longer paths. Going too far left/up creates inefficiency, not impassability.\nGeneral direction: Southeast (down-right). Optimal: Hug top/right edges to avoid (5,5).\nFailed approaches: (1) Down first then RRR on row 5: D to (5,3), RR to (5,5)# blocked—must detour (e.g., DRRD RR, longer or same but riskier).

All other cells are empty (-).\n\nKey patterns and constraints: The grid is mostly open with only two walls. The wall at (4,5) is in the upper-right area and unlikely to affect paths to the bottom-left goal unless detouring far right. The critical wall is at (6,2), directly adjacent to the goal on the right, blocking access to (6,1) from the right along row 6. Player must reach (6,1) primarily from above (5,1) via down move, as left edge prevents left approach and right is blocked by wall. Manhattan distance: 3 down + 1 left = 4 moves minimum. Moves must stay within 1-6 bounds; no diagonal moves; walls impassable.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Need to move generally down (net +3 rows) and left (net -1 column) to reach goal. Shortest paths are 4 moves. Multiple viable paths exist due to open grid, but some lead to dead ends or unnecessary length.\n\n- Possible paths: Direct to column 1 early (e.g., left then down x3), or down first then left (e.g., down then left then down x2). Both shortest.\n- Blocked paths: Straight down column 2 (DDD from (3,2) hits (6,2) #). Any path entering row 6 from column 3+ cannot reach (6,1) without passing through (6,2) # (e.g., row 6 right-to-left blocked).\n- Dead ends/traps: Reaching (5,2) then down hits #; must backtrack left/up. Far right paths (e.g., right to column 6, down) hit (4,5) # or become inefficient (10+ moves). Bottom row traps if enter row 6 column 3-6: cannot left to goal without hitting (6,2).\n- General direction: Prioritize left to column 1 before final downs to avoid bottom wall; down-left order flexible early.\n- Failing approaches: Greedy down-first without left adjustment fails at (6,2). Rightward exploration wastes moves (increases Manhattan). Ignoring bounds (e.g., left from column 1) invalid. BFS mentally: explore level-by-level from start, prune walls/out-of-bounds. A* heuristic (Manhattan) favors left/down. Avoid cycles in open grid by tracking visited, but unnecessary here.\n\nWhy certain approaches fail: Right-then-down-then-left fails efficiency and risks (4,5) #; bottom-looping impossible due to (6,2). Teaches: Identify chokepoints (walls near goal) early; compute blockages on direct lines.\n\nGeneric strategies: 1) Parse grid fully, note obstacles relative to start/goal. 2) Compute Manhattan, check direct path. 3) Visualize/mentally simulate key blockages. 4) Enumerate short paths, prune dead-ends. 5) Prefer obstacle-avoiding vectors (here, shift left before final descent).

General direction: Primarily left (west) ~2-3 spaces, slight down (south) to row 2. Failing approaches: Greedy down-first fails (wall); full left to col 1 in row 1 impossible (walls at col 4/2); bottom detour (down to row 2 col 8 impossible due to col 9 wall, so must loop around right bound uselessly) inefficient and risks bounds.

Player starts at position (5,5). Goal is at (4,2). Key wall locations include: (1,6), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (7,1), (7,3), (8,3), (8,4), (8,6), (10,2). Additional walls are scattered, creating mazelike barriers especially around the start-goal area. Patterns/constraints: Dense walls block direct northwest path from start to goal—specifically, # at (5,2) and (4,3) create a barrier forcing a detour. Bottom half has partial openness but traps like row 7-8 walls. Top half open but goal isolated on left. Bounds: Moves must stay in 1-10 rows, 1-7 cols. No diagonal moves; only orthogonal.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nGeneral direction: Up 1, left 3 net, but direct paths fail due to walls. Multiple possible paths exist: short detours via bottom-left (like row 6), longer loops via right/top (e.g., up to row 3, right, down around), or bottom-right then left (riskier). Blocked paths: Direct left from start hits (5,2)# after two lefts; up then left hits (4,3)#; left-left-up hits (4,3)#. Dead ends/traps: From (5,3), up blocked (#), left blocked (#), forces down or backtrack. Top-right loop (e.g., (4,5)->(3,5)->(2,5)->left) dead-ends at (3,4)# and distant from goal. Bottom-right risky due to row7 (7,1)# (7,3)#, row8 clusters blocking leftward progress without backtrack. Approaches that fail: Greedy direct (up/left) ignores local blocks, leads to immediate collision. BFS-style mental search (explore neighbors level-by-level) reveals shortest ~8 moves via bottom-left detour. Generic strategies: 1) Visualize/manually BFS mentally: enqueue positions, dequeue, check neighbors. 2) Identify chokepoints (e.g., (4,3)# forces south detour). 3) High-level: Net vector (up1 left3), find bypasses. 4) Prune dead ends early (no-exit zones like post-(5,3) without down). 5) Extensible: Modular—decompose to subgoals (e.g., reach row6 col1), recombine; transfer to graphs/RL by state-action modeling, heuristic (Manhattan dist + obstacle penalty).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen path: Detour south around (5,2)# via row6 open corridor to left flank, then north to goal row, east to G. Avoids all traps.\n- Start: (5,5). Move L → (5,4) [- open].\n- Current: (5,4). Move L → (5,3) [- open], navigates toward left but preps for down detour (up would be (4,3)#).\n- Current: (5,3).

Wall locations:\n- Row 1, column 8: single #.\n- Row 6: columns 1, 6, 9.\n- Row 10: columns 8 and 9 (##).\n\nPatterns/constraints: The grid is mostly open space ('-'), with sparse walls. Key constraints near the goal: Row 10 has ## at columns 8-9, blocking vertical passage there between rows 10-11 if trying to cross upward, but irrelevant for reaching row 11 column 7 directly. Row 6 walls create potential barriers higher up (e.g., column 1 fully blocked at row 6, partial blocks at columns 6 and 9). Rows 11-12 are fully open (row 11 has G at column 7, treated as passable; row 12 empty except player). No walls block the bottom-right area. Player needs net movement: up 1 row, left 5 columns. Bounds: rows 1-12, columns 1-12 (cannot go outside).\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple possible paths exist due to open bottom rows (e.g., go left 5 then up 1; or up 1 then left 5; or interleave like left 3, up 1, left 2). Shortest paths are 6 moves (Manhattan distance: 1 up + 5 left). Paths blocked: Any attempting to pass through # cells (e.g., cannot go up from row 11 column 8/9 into row 10 columns 8/9). Dead ends/traps: \n- Row 10 columns 8-9: If path goes up there prematurely (e.g., from row 11 col 8 up), hits wall—no way around without backtracking left/right.\n- Row 6 walls: If over-navigating up/left (e.g., up to row 6 col 1 or col 6/9), blocked; col 1 row 6 creates a 'dead end' if hugging left wall upward.\n- Right/upper bounds: Going right from col 12 or up beyond row 1 useless/out-of-bounds.\nGeneral direction: Primarily left (to col 7), minimal up (only 1 row). Stay in rows 11-12 corridor, which is fully open.\nApproaches that fail:\n- Going up first excessively (e.g., UUUUUU): Hits row 6 walls or distant obstacles, far from goal.\n- Hugging right edge up: Reaches row 10 col 12 (open), but row 10 col 12 to col 7 requires left navigation around ## at col 8-9—possible but longer (must go left to col 10, up-blocked detour unnecessary).\n- Direct diagonal simulation (no diagonals allowed): Forces stepwise U/L, but open space allows.\n- BFS/DFS mentally: Prioritize bottom corridor (rows 11-12) as lowest-risk, no walls.\nGeneric strategies: Identify open corridors (here, rows 11-12); compute net displacement; enumerate short paths first; flag local obstacles (row 10 ## as 'avoid upward'); test for dead ends by simulating 'what if continue?'; extensible to mazes via prioritizing adjacent empties, backtrack on blocks.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: LLLLLU (direct left along open row 12, then up—minimal risk, shortest).

Generic strategy lesson: Always map all obstacles first to identify 'corridors' (open paths like col 1 here) vs. 'barriers' (central # clusters); this scales to larger grids by prioritizing unobstructed lanes toward the goal direction.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nGeneral direction needed: Primarily down (increase row from 1 to 4) and slightly left (col 2 to 1). From start (1,2), evaluate moves:\n- U: Out of bounds (row 0 invalid).\n- D: Hits # at (2,2).\n- R: Hits # at (1,3).\n- L: Open to (1,1) -\nOnly one viable first move (L), a classic chokepoint.\n\nMultiple paths exist but vary in length: Shortest is left then straight down col 1 (LDDD). Longer alternatives: After reaching lower rows via col 1, detour right into open bottom (rows 5-7, cols 1/4/5), loop around row 7 # at col 3, then up col 1 to G (e.g., LDDDD RRR UUUU or similar, much longer). \n\nBlocked paths:\n- Direct down col 2: Blocked by # at (2,2)/(3,2).\n- Rightward from start: Permanent # wall at (1,3).\n- Central crossing: Rows 2-3 cols 2-3 fully walled, row 5 cols 2-3 walled—no shortcut through middle.\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid: Right side (cols 4-5) is accessible only via bottom loop (row 6+), but row 7 col 3 # creates a minor cul-de-sac if entering from col 2 (impassable). No true traps (grid is solvable without backtracking if choosing left corridor), but detours waste steps. \n\nFailed approaches and why:\n- BFS/DFS ignoring bounds: U from start crashes.\n- Greedy 'down only': Immediate # block at (2,2).\n- 'Right then down': Can't even start right.\n- Assuming open center: Hits multiple # clusters.\nGeneric lesson: Use 'feasible move enumeration' at each step (check 4 directions vs. walls/bounds); prioritize paths aligning with goal vector (here down-left); explore branches depth-first but backtrack on dead ends. For transfer: In mazes/games, compute 'Manhattan distance' (here |4-1| + |1-2| = 4 steps min) and seek obstacle-free approximations; visualize as graph where nodes=cells, edges=valid moves.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: LDDD (shortest, direct corridor path; extensible as 'follow open lane').\n- Current: (1,2). Move L. New: (1,1) [navigates around right # at (1,3); enters open col 1 corridor].\n- Current: (1,1). Move D. New: (2,1) [bypasses central # barrier in row 2 cols 2-3].\n- Current: (2,1). Move D. New: (3,1) [continues safe vertical path, avoids row 3 central #].\n- Current: (3,1). Move D. New: (4,1) G [reaches goal; col 1 confirmed open throughout].\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace from start (1,2):\n1. L → (1,1): Cell = -, bounds OK, no #.\n2. D → (2,1): Cell = -, bounds OK, no #.\n3. D → (3,1): Cell = -, bounds OK, no #.\n4. D → (4,1): Cell = G, bounds OK, no #.\nEnd at exact goal (4,1). Total moves: 4. No wall hits, no out-of-bounds (all rows 1-4, cols 1-2). Path verified collision-free. No errors found. Generic check: Re-simulate on grid mentally; count steps vs. Manhattan (matches min). For other domains: Always 'replay' solution trace to catch off-by-one errors.</think>\n\n{\"solution\": \"LDDD\"}"}],"llmPathLength":4}

No continuous barriers divide the grid into isolated regions; all areas are connected around the walls. Key constraints include staying within bounds (rows 1-12, columns 1-7), avoiding walls, and no diagonal moves. The walls in row 1 (cols 2-4,7) block direct top access in those columns but are above the goal (row 4). The wall at row 3 col 4 creates a local obstacle mid-upper grid. Row 9 col 1 is a potential trap below the start but irrelevant for upward paths. Manhattan distance: 4 rows up + 5 columns left = 9 moves minimum. Vertical corridor in column 1 (rows 4-8) is fully open, enabling simple paths.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist due to open space (e.g., left-then-up, up-then-left, zigzag).

Wall locations: row 2 column 0 (#), row 4 column 7 (#), row 5 column 7 (#).\n\nPatterns and constraints: The grid is mostly open space (-), with only three isolated walls. The wall at row 2 col 0 blocks access to the lower-left corner but doesn't impede paths to the goal. The walls at row 4-5 col 7 create a minor blockage in the bottom-right corner, preventing movement into those cells but not trapping the player anywhere. All moves must stay within bounds (rows 0-5, cols 0-7) and avoid # cells. No diagonal moves; only orthogonal (U/D/L/R). The goal is immediately adjacent: one row up and one column left, suggesting short paths exist.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: The minimal displacement is up 1 row and left 1 column, so shortest paths are length 2 (e.g., UL or LU). Multiple paths exist due to open space: direct adjacent moves, or longer detours like right then up-left, down then around, etc. However, prioritize shortest to minimize risk of errors.\n\nBlocked paths: No direct blocks to goal, but attempting left/down into row 2 col 0 hits the wall (e.g., from start D to row 2 col 6 (open), then LLLL to col 2 would be open, but LLLLLL to col 0 hits #). Bottom-right walls block row 4-5 col 7: e.g., from row 3 col 7 R/D impossible since col 7 is right edge, but D from row 3 col 7 to row 4 col 7 is #.\n\nDead ends/traps: No true dead ends (grid not maze-like; fully traversable except walls), but bottom-right corner is inaccessible (row 5 col 7 #, row 4 col 7 # blocks access from left/up). Going down-right extensively leads to bounded area but escapable upward/leftward. Avoid by not venturing far south-east.\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily up (decrease row) and left (decrease col), with flexibility.\n\nApproaches that fail and why:\n- Going only down (DDDDDD): Hits bottom bounds and right walls, no path to top goal; wastes moves.\n- Going left then down into wall: From start L to row1 col5, D to row2 col5 (open), but further left to row2 col0 #: unnecessary and blocks further left.\n- Going right to col7 then up: From start R to row1 col7 (open), U to row0 col7 (open), then L L to goal: works but longer (RLL). Fails if mistakenly RR (out of bounds).\n- Ignoring bounds: R from col7 = out of bounds (invalid).\nGeneric strategies: Mentally simulate BFS (breadth-first search) for shortest path: explore neighbors level-by-level, enqueue valid empty cells. Heuristics like Manhattan distance (|Δrow| + |Δcol| = 2) guide. Visualize grid mentally or sketch. Backtrack from dead ends. Extensible: In larger mazes, prioritize low-Manhattan, avoid walls/dead ends via flood-fill thinking; transfer to A* by adding heuristics.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: UL (shortest, direct).

Blocked paths: Direct rightward movement hits row 3 col 12 # quickly (e.g., RRRRRR dead-ends at col 11, can't proceed up/down/right easily due to adjacent # in row 2/4 col 11). Downward exploration leads to mazelike lower grid with potential traps (e.g., row 6 col 6 # blocks center; row 8 cols 4/9 create chokepoints; row 12 col 1 # blocks bottom-left corner, forcing long detours). Dead ends/traps to avoid: Right side walls form a partial barrier (cols 11-12 multiple rows); lower central # at row 6 col 6 funnels traffic awkwardly; approaching row 12 col 1 # traps if overcommitted down-left. General direction: Prioritize left/up early to stay in open top-left quadrant.

The player (@) starts at row 2, column 6. The goal (G) is at row 2, column 3. There are no walls (#) anywhere on the grid—all cells are empty (-), except for the player and goal positions, which are passable. The player can move up (U: decrease row), down (D: increase row), left (L: decrease column), right (R: increase column), but must stay within bounds (rows 1-6, columns 1-10). Key constraint: no obstacles, so any path staying in bounds works, but we seek an efficient path. Patterns: completely open space, same-row start and goal (row 2), only need to shift left by 3 columns.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nSince there are no walls, every cell is accessible, allowing infinitely many paths (e.g., detours up/down/right then corrections). Shortest paths are 3 moves left (LLL), as the Manhattan distance is 3 left. Multiple paths exist: direct LLL (optimal); longer loops like U LLL D (5 moves), R LLLL (4 moves), or arbitrary detours (e.g., D D U U LLL). No paths are blocked, but some lead to dead ends relative to efficiency—e.g., going right increases distance (to col 10, then must return 7 left). Traps to avoid: hitting bounds, like L from col 1 (illegal) or U from row 1. General direction: primarily left (net -3 columns), no row change needed. Failing approaches: (1) Going right/down/up unnecessarily lengthens path and risks bounds (e.g., RRRRRRR to col 10, then LLLLLLLLL wastes moves); (2) Overshooting left beyond col 3 then correcting (e.g., LLLL to col 2, then R) adds moves; (3) Random zigzags (e.g., U D L U D L) work but inefficient; (4) Ignoring bounds near edges (e.g., from start, LLL then LL hits col 1, can't go further left without backtracking). Best strategy: direct path along row 2 (LLL), as it minimizes moves, avoids bounds, no detours needed. BFS/DFS mentally: level 1: 3 neighbors, level 3 reaches goal without branches blocked.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: direct left along row 2 (LLL), as it's shortest and obstacle-free.\n- Current position: row 2, col 6. Direction: L. New position: row 2, col 5 (empty -, no obstacles).\n- Current position: row 2, col 5. Direction: L. New position: row 2, col 4 (empty -, no obstacles).\n- Current position: row 2, col 4. Direction: L. New position: row 2, col 3 (goal G, no obstacles).\nThis navigates the 3-column gap directly, staying in row 2.\n\n# Verification\n\nStart: row 2, col 6 (valid, empty).\n1.

Longer paths exist, e.g., left to col 5 row 8, up to row 7 col 5, right to goal (LULR, 4 moves); or down to row 9 then around (inefficient). Paths wrapping around the right walls (e.g., R to col 11, U multiple times) work but longer (10+ moves).\n\nBlocked paths: Cannot go right from row 7 col 7 to col 8 (wall at row 7 col 8). Cannot pass row 5 cols 6-7 ## if approaching from below-right. Direct down-right from start hits no immediate block but diverges. Top-left wall (row 1 col 2) irrelevant.\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid: Row 7 col 8 is a wall, so no entry, but adjacent opens (e.g., from row 7 col 7 right fails). Right side has partial barriers (row 4-6 high cols), e.g., going up-right from start to row 5 col 8+, then left blocked by row 5 col 6-7 ##, forcing detour south or east—potential loop trap if not tracking progress.

Prioritize these vectors to minimize moves.\nApproaches that would fail:\n- Going right/up first: Increases distance (e.g., R adds need for extra L later; total moves >5).\n- Over-left/up: Hits bounds (e.g., 4L from start: after LLL to (2,1), L to (2,0) invalid).\n- Looping/circling: Unnecessary in open space but wastes moves; in mazes, avoid cycles via visited tracking.\nGeneric strategies: Use Manhattan distance for heuristic. BFS for shortest path in unweighted grid (extensible to weighted graphs). Check bounds pre-move. Explore alternatives systematically (e.g., prioritize horizontal/vertical). In obstructed grids, A* with heuristic; here, naive enumeration suffices.\nChosen strategy: LLLDD - clears left buffer first (safe, hugs left bound), then down.

Player starts at (row 5, column 4). Goal at (row 3, column 5). Wall locations: (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (8,5), (9,1). All other cells are empty (-), passable, or the goal (G).\n\nPatterns/constraints: The grid is mostly open space with sparse walls clustered in the top-left (rows 1-2, cols 1 and 3) and bottom (row 8 col 5, row 9 col 1). No walls block the direct path from start to goal in the central-right area (cols 4-5, rows 3-5). Key constraints: Moves must stay within row 1-10, col 1-5; cannot pass # walls. General movement: U decreases row, D increases row, L decreases col, R increases col. Net displacement needed: up 2 rows, right 1 column. Top-left walls irrelevant to shortest path; bottom walls could trap if detouring down but avoidable.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Multiple paths exist due to open space, e.g., UUR, RUU, URU (all length 3, shortest). Direct path (up then right) stays in cols 4-5, rows 3-5: fully open. General direction: primarily up (to row 3), slight right (to col 5).\n\nBlocked paths: None directly block shortest routes. Top-left walls block extreme left-up moves (e.g., from col 1 row 3 U to row 2 col 1 hits #; row 1 col 3 #). Bottom-right wall at (8,5) blocks if going down-right (e.g., DDRR hits # at (8,5)). Row 9 col 1 # blocks bottom-left corner.\n\nDead ends/traps: No true dead ends from start, but potential traps if detouring: going left to col 1 then down hits (9,1) # with limited escape (row 10 open but loops back up). Going down to row 8+ col 5 hits #, forcing left detour. Avoid by not going down (away from goal) or left unnecessarily.\n\nApproaches that fail:\n- Going left first (e.g., LLLUUUR): Works but longer (7 moves), risks top-left walls if over-left.\n- Going down (e.g., DDD): Moves away, risks bottom traps, requires 2+ up to compensate per down.\n- Overshooting up (UUUU): Hits top bounds row 1, then walls if left (row 1 col 3 #), forces down detour.\n- Ignoring bounds: RRR from start exits col 6 (invalid).\n\nGeneric strategies: Mentally map relative positions (goal NW of start); prioritize direct net moves (2U 1R); explore shortest first (BFS-like: level 1: U/D/L/R; level 2: combinations; level 3 reaches goal); identify obstacle-free corridors (here cols 4-5 open vertically); avoid opposite directions (no D); check alternates for robustness; extensible to mazes: use wall-following if dense, A* heuristics (distance to goal), or visualize reduced grid.\n\nChosen solution: UUR (direct, shortest, central path; alternatives like RUU equally valid but UUR prioritizes vertical progress).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nStart: (5,4)\n- Move U: Navigate up in open col 4 (no walls rows 3-5 col 4); new pos (4,4), empty.\n- Move U: Continue up col 4, avoids left walls; new pos (3,4), empty.\n- Move R: Shift right to goal column, row 3 cols 4-5 open; new pos (3,5), goal.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace for UUR:\n1.

No walls block the central columns (2-5) from row 3 to 9, allowing relatively free vertical movement upward. Upper walls form a partial barrier: row 2 col 3 is blocked, preventing direct access to row 1 col 3 from below without detours. The goal is in row 3 col 4, accessible from below or sides. Bounds (rows 1-9, cols 1-5) must be respected—no moves off-grid. General displacement needed: up 4 rows, right 1 column.

The entire grid is open space filled with empty cells (-), except for the player and goal positions.\nKey patterns/constraints: Fully open grid with no obstacles, but bounded by grid edges (cannot move outside rows 1-6 or columns 1-8). Player must move exactly 3 rows down (from row 1 to row 4) and 1 column right (from column 3 to column 4), for a Manhattan distance of 4 moves. No impassable areas, so any path consisting of 3 'D's and 1 'R' in any order will work, as long as it respects bounds. Direct paths are shortest; detours (e.g., moving left/up) would require compensatory moves, making them longer.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Multiple possible paths exist due to the open grid—any sequence of exactly 3 'D' (down) and 1 'R' (right) reaches the goal in 4 moves (shortest path length). For example:\n- Down-first: DDDR (stays somewhat central).\n- Right-first: RDDD (shifts right early).\n- Interleaved: DRDD, DDRD, etc.\n\nBlocked paths: None, as no walls. However, paths hitting boundaries could be invalid:\n- Cannot go U from row 1 (out of bounds).\n- Cannot go L from column 1, R from column 8, D from row 6.\n\nDead ends/traps: None, since open grid—no loops or blocks leading to inescapable areas. However, inefficient strategies create 'virtual dead ends':\n- Going L (left) from col 3 to col 2/1 requires later R's to compensate, lengthening path (e.g., LDRDD = 5 moves, suboptimal).\n- Going U impossible at start, but if detouring down then up, adds pairs of D/U (wasted moves).\n- Going extra R to col 8 then back L wastes moves.\n\nGeneral direction needed: Primarily down (net +3 rows) and slightly right (net +1 column). Prioritize D's to descend quickly, insert R anywhere safe.\n\nApproaches that would fail:\n- Only D's (DDD): Ends at (4,3), misses goal—needs R.\n- Ignoring bounds: e.g., U from start invalid.\n- Over-detouring: Going to row 6 then back up requires 5 extra moves (3D to row 4, 2D to 6, 2U back)—possible but inefficient.\n- Random moves without tracking deltas: Could wander (e.g., RL loop forever), but systematic delta-tracking (Δrow=+3, Δcol=+1) ensures success.\nGeneric strategy extensible to other domains: Compute Manhattan distance (sum of |Δrow| + |Δcol|), plan net moves needed, enumerate short sequences avoiding bounds/obstacles. Use BFS mentally for shortest path in open/bounded grids; prioritize primary direction (here down) to minimize backtracking.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: DDDR (down-first then right—simple, stays near start column until final adjustment).\n- Start: row 1, col 3.\n  Move D → New position: row 2, col 3.

(Open below; continues direct descent, avoiding any potential left/right distractions.)\n- Current: row 3, col 3.\n  Move D → New position: row 4, col 3.

E.g., LDDDR: (1,3)L→(1,2)[open but away], then D→(2,2),D→(3,2),D→(4,2),R→(4,3),R→(4,4)—6 moves, hits no walls but inefficient (extra L/R pair).\n\n# Verification\n\nTrace entire solution DDDR move-by-move:\n1.

Boundaries (rows 1-10, cols 1-10) must be respected; no diagonal moves allowed.

Right (R) or excessive down (beyond row 6) leads to longer paths or bounds issues (e.g., col 10 or row 10).\n\nDead ends/traps: Minimal risk in open grid, but wall at (2,6) is a single-cell trap—entering adjacent cells is fine, but cannot occupy it. Avoid unnecessary U moves to prevent backtracking.

Failing approaches: Straight up from start to (5,7) then left hits nothing directly but row 5 col 7 empty, left to col 6 empty, but col 5 goal—wait, viable but longer (ULULULUL or similar, 8+ moves).

Upward paths risk dead ends if hitting top wall without space to maneuver.\nDead ends/traps: Minor—row 1 col 1 is a corner trap (cannot go up/left from there).

Player starts at row 7, column 1 (@). Goal at row 6, column 3 (G). Wall locations (#): row 3 col 3, row 3 col 5, row 4 col 4, row 4 col 6, row 6 col 1, row 7 col 3, row 8 col 1. Additional empty cells everywhere else (-). Patterns/constraints: Walls form partial barriers in the upper-middle (rows 3-4, blocking direct diagonal paths if going high), and lower-left traps (row 6 col 1 #, row 7 col 3 #, row 8 col 1 # create local obstacles near start). Overall, open space above row 5, but lower rows have walls forcing rightward then upward movement near start. Bounds prevent moving outside rows 1-8 or cols 1-6. Shortest path likely minimal moves (Manhattan distance ~3: up 1, right 2), but walls may require detours.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Direct Manhattan path (right, right, up) blocked by wall at row 7 col 3 (#), so cannot R R U. Instead, R U R circumvents by going around the wall at row 7 col 3 and row 6 col 1. Multiple paths exist: primary short path RUR (3 moves). Longer alternatives: from (7,2) go D to (8,2), R to (8,3), R to (8,4), U to (7,4), L to (7,3)? No, (7,3)# blocks, so from (7,4) U to (6,4), L to (6,3) G (path: R D R R U L, 6 moves). Even longer via upper grid: from goal area up to row 5 open, navigate around row 3-4 walls (e.g., to col 6 then left), but unnecessary as lower path shorter. Blocked paths: From start, U to (6,1)# impassable; D to (8,1)# impassable; L out-of-bounds. Dead ends/traps: Going D from (7,2) to (8,2) leads to row 8 corridor (cols 2-6 open), but upward blocked at col 3 (7,3#), col 1 (8,1#), forcing long detour right/up/left; cul-de-sac if go leftish. Upper walls create potential loops (e.g., row 3 col 3# and row 4 col 4# block center, row 3 col 5# and row 4 col 6# block right, forcing left or wide paths if mistakenly go high). General direction: Primarily up 1 net, right 2 net, so prioritize right to skirt lower walls, then up, avoiding left/down. Failing approaches: Greedy up-first fails (immediate wall); right-right fails (hits row 7 col 3 #); down-first traps in row 8 dead-end requiring backtrack. Generic strategies: Use systematic search like BFS for shortest path (extensible to larger mazes); compute Manhattan heuristic but adjust for walls; identify local constraints first (start only allows R); prune dead ends by checking neighbor openness and distance to goal; visualize net displacement; test alternates pre-emptively to teach backtracking avoidance; applicable to any grid pathfinding (e.g., robotics, games) by modularizing: analyze locals, simulate paths, verify bounds.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: RUR (shortest, direct circumvent). Start at (7,1). Move 1: R to (7,2) [empty -; navigates around impending wall at (7,3)# by moving right first]. Now at (7,2). Move 2: U to (6,2) [empty -; avoids left wall at (6,1)# and positions for final right to goal]. Now at (6,2).

The player (@) starts at position (row 3, column 4). The goal (G) is at (row 2, column 1). There are no walls (#) anywhere on the grid—all cells are empty (-), except for the player and goal positions. Key constraints include staying within bounds: rows 1-9, columns 1-4.

Patterns/constraints: The grid is mostly open space, with walls primarily in the lower half (rows 6-10) forming potential barriers on the left and right edges. A single wall at row 2 col 5 blocks direct upward movement from start. Top area (rows 1-5) is nearly fully open except that one wall. Goal is immediately adjacent diagonally down-right. Bounds: rows 1-11, cols 1-6; cannot go out of bounds or onto #.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nGoal is just 1 row down and 1 column right from start, suggesting shortest paths of length 2: 'RD' (right to (3,6), down to (4,6)) or 'DR' (down to (4,5), right to (4,6)). Both cells (3,6) and (4,5) are empty (-). Multiple paths exist: these two direct ones, plus longer detours (e.g., left then loop around). Blocked paths: Cannot go U from start to (2,5) due to wall. Cannot go R then U (backtracks). Dead ends/traps: Lower right blocked at row 6 col 6 #, so paths going down col 6 too far trap (cannot proceed right/down, must backtrack left/up). Left side has vertical wall at col 2 rows 6-7,10 blocking narrow passages. Bottom row 10 col 5-6 ## is a dead end corner. General direction: Minimal movement down-right; no need to go up/left/bottom. Failing approaches: (1) Going U first: hits wall at (2,5), invalid. (2) Going far down col 6: hits # at (6,6), dead end requiring backtrack. (3) Looping left to col 1 then down: works but inefficient (e.g., 20+ moves), risks lower dead ends like row 10 col 2 # narrowing path. (4) Ignoring bounds: e.g., R from col 6 invalid. Generic strategy: Mentally map adjacent cells, prioritize shortest paths (Manhattan distance=2), explore alternatives via BFS-like thinking (check all directions, prune blocked), identify dead ends by scanning for # clusters, avoid backtracking unless necessary. This transfers to mazes: compute distance, flag obstacles, simulate paths.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: 'RD' (shortest, avoids any potential lower traps).\n- Current position: row 3 col 5.

New position: row 4 col 6 (G, no obstacles).\nAlternate 'DR':\n- Current: 3,5 D to 4,5 (empty -, avoids upper wall).\n- Current: 4,5 R to 4,6 (G).\nLonger path example (to illustrate avoidance): L to 3,4; D to 4,4; R to 4,5; R to 4,6 (works but extra moves); or down to row 11 then up (works, navigates around row 6 col 6 # by staying col 5 leftward).\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace for 'RD':\n1.

The entire grid is open space filled with '-' (empty cells). No '#' walls present.\nPatterns or constraints: Fully traversable grid with no obstacles. Key constraints are grid boundaries: rows 1-11, columns 1-4. Player must move exactly 8 units up (from row 11 to row 3) and 2 units left (from column 3 to column 1). Total Manhattan distance: 10 moves minimum. No patterns like mazes or chokepoints; it's an open rectangle.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Since there are no walls, every path consisting of exactly 8 'U' (up, decreases row) and 2 'L' (left, decreases column) will reach the goal, as long as moves stay within bounds. The number of possible paths is combinatorial: 10! / (8! * 2!) = 45 distinct sequences.\nMultiple possible paths: Yes, e.g., all lefts first then ups (LLUUUUUUUU), all ups first then lefts (UUUUUUUULL), or interleaved like ULULUUUUUU.\nBlocked paths: None due to walls, but invalid moves include: going left from column 1 (out of bounds), right from column 4 (unnecessary but possible), up from row 1, down from row 11. Paths with 'D' (down) or excess 'R' (right) would fail by either going out of bounds or not reaching the goal (e.g., 'R' moves away from goal column).\nDead ends or traps: None structurally, but self-imposed traps include: moving down ('D') from row 11 (hits bottom bound, wastes moves), moving right ('R') to column 4 then struggling to correct (requires extra lefts, but since we need net 2 lefts from col 3, going to col 4 requires 3 lefts total, possible but inefficient). Going up beyond row 3 then down would work but adds unnecessary moves.\nGeneral direction: Primarily up (net +8 rows up) and left (net +2 columns left). Stay in columns 1-4 to avoid bounds issues.\nApproaches that would fail and why:\n- Including 'D' or 'R' without compensating moves: Fails to net the required displacement (e.g., one 'D' requires an extra 'U' to compensate, lengthening path unnecessarily; we seek minimal path).\n- Moving left >2 times without rights: Hits column 1 bound early, can't go further left (e.g., LLL from start goes to col0 invalid).\n- BFS/DFS unnecessary due to openness, but in general mazes, they'd find shortest path; here shortest is any 10-move combo of 8U+2L.\nChosen strategy: Minimal path - lefts first to column 1 (safest, hugs left bound), then ups to goal. Avoids rightward drifts. Alternative: ups first to row 3 col 3, then lefts (also safe). Interleaving fine but left-first prevents any bound issues if hypothetically walls existed on right.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: LLUUUUUUUU (2 lefts then 8 ups). This hugs the left wall after lefts, efficient and bound-safe.\n- Start: row 11, col 3\n- Move 1: L → row 11, col 2 (empty, within col 1-4)\n- Move 2: L → row 11, col 1 (empty, left bound reached)\n- Move 3: U → row 10, col 1 (empty)\n- Move 4: U → row 9, col 1 (empty)\n- Move 5: U → row 8, col 1 (empty)\n- Move 6: U → row 7, col 1 (empty)\n- Move 7: U → row 6, col 1 (empty)\n- Move 8: U → row 5, col 1 (empty)\n- Move 9: U → row 4, col 1 (empty)\n- Move 10: U → row 3, col 1 (goal G reached)\nNo obstacles (none exist).

No full barriers, but paths must navigate around these. Manhattan distance: 7 up + 2 left = 9 moves minimum.

Rightward path explored but fails as a shortcut.\nBlocked paths:\n- Direct left from (3,6): Hits (3,5)# immediately.\n- Up then left: U to (2,6), then L hits (2,5)#; can't cross (2,4)-(2,5)##.\n- Rightward loop: R to (3,7), U/R to row 2 right side (up to col10), but can't circle top (1,10)# or drop to row 3 col10 and left (hits (3,9)#). Dead end; requires backtrack, longer than bottom path.\nDead ends/traps: Right side (row 3 col7-10) leads to cul-de-sac due to (3,8)-(3,9)## and no top wraparound. Over-committing up from start strands in row 2 right side, unable to reach left without full detour.\nApproaches that fail:\n- BFS/DFS without detour awareness: Gets stuck at local barriers.\n- Greedy (always toward goal): Tries L (blocked) or U then L (blocked).\n- Ignoring row 4: No path without it, as row 1-3 don't connect right-to-left.\nBest strategy: Detour down to row 4 (open highway), travel left under barrier, ascend on open left channel (row 3 col2-4 to goal). Extensible: Identify chokepoints/barriers, find bypass corridors (here row 4), prioritize open lanes for traversal.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Detour down to row 4, left to col2, up to goal. Avoids all walls, minimal length (7 moves).\n- Start: (3,6)\n- D: Move down, navigating around implicit row 3 left block. New: (4,6) (open -).\n- L: Left along open row 4.

All other cells are empty (-).\n\nPatterns and constraints: The grid is mostly open in the upper half (rows 1-5), with a single wall at (2,3) that doesn't affect downward paths from the start. Lower half (rows 6-12) has clustered walls on the right side: column 5 blocked at rows 6-7, column 4 blocked at row 8, column 2 blocked at row 9. Column 1 is completely open from row 5 to 12. Column 3 is fully open from row 5 to 12. No walls in columns 1 or 3 block downward progress. Bounds: cannot move outside rows 1-12 or columns 1-5. Net movement needed: 7 down (row 12-5=7), 2 right (col 3-1=2), Manhattan distance 9 moves minimum. Path must avoid walls and stay in bounds.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple possible paths exist due to open corridors in columns 1 and 3. Primary safe paths: (1) Move down column 1 to row 12, then right to column 3 (7D + 2R). (2) Move right to column 3 first, then down to goal (2R + 7D). Both are minimal length (9 moves) and avoid all walls.\n\nBlocked paths:\n- Column 5: impassable downward from row 5 due to walls at (6,5) and (7,5); attempting RRRR D from start hits wall.\n- Column 4: blocked at row 8 (wall at (8,4)); path like RRR DDD D hits wall at (8,4).\n- Column 2: blocked at row 9 (wall at (9,2)); path like R followed by 4D reaches (9,2) wall, creating a dead end—forcing left/right detour.\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid:\n- Right-heavy paths trap player in row 5-7 column 5 (cannot down).\n- Mid-right paths (column 4) dead-end at row 8.\n- Column 2 path dead-ends at row 9, requiring backtrack (e.g., from (8,2) cannot D, must L to col1 or R to col3).\n- No need to go up (row 4+ open but increases distance); wall at (2,3) irrelevant for down paths.\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily down (7 net), slight right (2 net). Prioritize open columns (1 or 3) for straight paths. Approaches that fail: Greedy right-then-down (hits col4/5 blocks); staying in col2 (hits row9 block); ignoring bounds (e.g., L from col1). Successful strategy: Scan columns for full vertical clearance, choose minimal-detour path, verify no chokepoints. Generic extensible strategies: (1) Identify safe corridors by column/row sweeps. (2) Compute Manhattan, check direct paths first. (3) Flag potential dead ends via blockage analysis (e.g., single-block chokepoints). (4) Simulate short detours but prefer straight lines. (5) Use mental BFS: explore neighbors, prune walls/bounds/out-of-way ups.

No other obstacles like enemies or one-way paths. Movement is grid-based orthogonal only (U/D/L/R). Bounds: rows 1-7, cols 1-10; out-of-bounds invalid.

Direct paths near start/goal are open.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Shortest paths require net 1 up and 1 left. Two minimal paths: UL (up to (5,2), left to (5,1)) or LU (left to (6,1), up to (5,1)) -- both 2 moves, fully open (no walls on these cells). Multiple longer paths exist, e.g., go right/up then detour left.\nBlocked paths: Direct rightward in row 6 stops at col 7 (#); row 5 leftward from col 6+ blocked by col 5 (#), forcing detour up to row 4 (open) then left/down. Top row 1 col 3-4 blocks crossing there horizontally.\nDead ends/traps: No true dead ends (grid connected), but potential traps include: row 7 col 6 (#) limits bottom navigation; row 6 col 7 (#) funnels right-side movement up/down first; row 5 col 5 (#) splits row 5 into left (cols 1-4 open to goal) and right (cols 6-10) sections -- crossing requires row 4/6 detour. Avoid by staying left.\nGeneral direction: Primarily up (1 row) and left (1 col); prioritize minimal moves to avoid detours.\nFailed approaches: (1) Going down first (e.g., D to (7,2)): wasteful, requires extra up moves later (e.g., D then LLUUU detour), longer than 2. (2) Going right extensively (e.g., RRRR to col 6 row 6): hits row 6 col 7 (#) or needs up early; to goal, must detour around row 5 col 5 (#) via row 4 (adds 4+ moves). (3) Going up to row 1 then left: open but overshoots (extra 4 up + left + 4 down = 10+ moves). (4) Ignoring walls (e.g., try row 5 col 5): invalid crash. Generic strategies: Compute Manhattan for lower bound; mentally BFS level-by-level from start (level 1: possible adjacents); prioritize goal quadrant (up-left); mark local obstacles (near start: row6 col7 #; near goal: row5 col5 #); test direct paths first; explore branches but prune blocked/long detours.

Start (6,2) L to (6,1) '-' (open left), U to (5,1) 'G'. Why UL? Arbitrary shortest; both teach direct minimalism. Longer alternate explored: R U LLL D (right detour, up row5 col3, left to goal) fails -- from row5 col3 L to col2 ok but inefficient; true right detour (e.g., to col6 row5) needs U LLLL D around col5 # (6+ moves).\n\n# Verification\n\nTrace UL move-by-move:\n1.

The grid is mostly open space with no other obstacles, clusters, or boundaries acting as walls except the grid edges. Key constraint: must avoid the wall at (2,6) and stay within bounds (rows 1-12, columns 1-10). Patterns: direct vertical path along column 10 is completely clear; the wall is offset to the left in row 2, not blocking column 10.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nThe general direction needed is primarily up (decrease row by 9 steps) with no net horizontal movement required, as start and goal share column 10. Multiple paths exist due to the open grid: any path that goes up 9 net steps while maneuvering around the wall if necessary. However, the direct path (9 Ups along column 10) is shortest (Manhattan distance 9) and unobstructed—every cell in column 10 from row 10 to row 1 is empty except the goal. Paths blocked: none on column 10, but any path crossing (2,6) fails (e.g., moving left to column 6 in row 2). Dead ends/traps: none, as the grid is fully connected except the single wall; no narrow corridors or loops leading to blocks. Alternate paths: go left (e.g., L to column 9), up several rows, right back to column 10 (longer by 2+ steps); or go down first then up (inefficient, risks bounds at row 12). Approaches that would NOT work: going through (2,6) (impassable); staying in lower rows indefinitely (never reaches goal); horizontal zigzags without net up progress (inefficient or bound-violating if excessive).

Player starts at row 2, column 6 (@). Goal is at row 4, column 1 (G). Wall locations: row 1 column 7 (#) and row 4 column 8 (#). All other cells are empty (-) and passable.\n\nKey patterns and constraints: The grid is mostly open with only two walls. The wall at (1,7) is in the upper right, potentially blocking upward or rightward detours but irrelevant for reaching the bottom-left goal. The wall at (4,8) blocks the far right of the bottom row but does not impede leftward movement to column 1 on row 4, as columns 1-7 on row 4 are open. No narrow corridors or chokepoints exist. Manhattan distance: 2 rows down + 5 columns left = 7 minimum moves. Player must stay within bounds (rows 1-4, columns 1-9) and avoid walls.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple possible paths exist due to the open grid, including: (1) Go fully left on row 2 to column 1, then down to row 4; (2) Go fully down to row 4 first, then left to column 1; (3) Interleave left and down moves (e.g., some left, down, more left). All valid paths are at least 7 moves; optimal paths are exactly 7 moves with exactly 5 L and 2 D in some order.\n\nBlocked paths: Going up (U) from start leads to row 1, where column 7 wall blocks rightward movement, but since goal is down-left, upward moves are unnecessary and inefficient. If over-right on row 4 (past column 7), the wall at (4,8) blocks access to column 9 from the left on row 4, but column 9 is accessible from above (row 3); however, this is a dead end for reaching column 1 without backtracking leftward earlier.\n\nDead ends or traps: Minimal risk. Going right (R) extensively (e.g., to column 9 on row 2 or 3) then down to row 4 column 9 creates a partial dead end because (4,8) wall prevents crossing left on row 4 to column 1—you'd need to backtrack up and left, wasting moves. Going up into row 1 and right hits (1,7) wall, forcing detour left or down, but again, irrelevant for goal. No inescapable traps; all areas connect back to open space.\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily left (net 5 columns) and down (net 2 rows). Prioritize left and down moves; avoid U or R unless correcting overshoot (not needed here).\n\nWhy certain approaches fail: Pure right/up strategy fails due to walls and wrong direction (moves away from goal). Staying on row 2 and going right hits no immediate wall but dead-ends directionally. Down-right to row 4 column 9 then left fails without backtrack due to (4,8) wall blocking row 4 left from column 9. BFS/DFS mentally: Shortest paths avoid detours; greedy left-then-down or down-then-left both work perfectly.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Left fully to column 1 on row 2 (open path: row 2 columns 1-9 all empty), then down twice to goal.

Other cells are empty (-). Patterns/constraints: Walls form partial barriers, especially vertically at row 3 col 5 (# right of start) and row 4 col 4 (# below start), blocking direct right and down moves. Upper area around goal is mostly open except col 6 and 9 in row 2. Lower grid has isolated walls creating potential mazes but irrelevant for shortest path.

Alternate paths include going left to col 3, up to row 2 col 3, then right twice to goal (4 moves total: LURR), or detours down after maneuvering around row 4 col 4 wall (much longer). Paths blocked: Direct right from start hits wall at (3,5); direct down hits wall at (4,4). Dead ends/traps: Going down from start impossible, but nearby left-down leads to open areas; however, row 6 col 6 and row 8 col 7 create pockets, e.g., looping lower left could trap in open space without progress to goal. General direction: Primarily up (decrease row by 1) and right (increase col by 1), minimal detour needed. Approaches that fail: Greedy right-first hits immediate wall at (3,5); down-first blocked at (4,4); over-right in row 3 to col 6+ then up risks row 2 col 9 wall but possible longer path. BFS-like mental search prioritizes adjacent empties: from (3,4), valid moves U to (2,4)-, L to (3,3)-; R/D blocked. From (2,4), R to goal viable.

The player starts at row 7, column 8 (bottom-right area). The goal is at row 2, column 6 (near the top, slightly left of center). There are no walls (#) anywhere on the grid—all cells are empty (-), with G marking the goal (passable) and @ the starting player position (also on an empty cell). Key variables: delta row = 7 - 2 = 5 steps up needed; delta column = 8 - 6 = 2 steps left needed. Total Manhattan distance: 7 moves minimum. Constraints: must stay within rows 1-8 and columns 1-8; no impassable cells, so no blocking patterns, but bounds act as implicit barriers. The grid is completely open, resembling an empty field with no obstacles, allowing free movement in four directions.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Since the grid is obstacle-free, any sequence of exactly 5 U (up) and 2 L (left) moves will reach the goal, as these provide the exact net displacement (up 5 rows, left 2 columns). Multiple paths exist (7! / (5! * 2!) = 21 shortest paths). No paths are blocked, as there are no walls. No dead ends or traps, since you can always backtrack or adjust in an open grid. General direction: primarily up (to reduce row from 7 to 2), secondarily left (column 8 to 6); avoid down/right to minimize moves, though possible. Alternate paths: (1) All left first then up (LLUUUUU)—stays on bottom edge then climbs straight up column 6. (2) All up first then left (UUUUULL)—climbs column 8 to top then shifts left. (3) Interleaved (e.g., UULUUUL)—zigzags slightly. Chosen: LLUUUUU for simplicity, as it aligns left early to column 6 then goes straight up, mimicking a 'staircase' approach. Paths to avoid for efficiency: Any extra D/R moves (e.g., R from col 8 invalid/out-of-bounds; D from row 7 goes to row 8, away from goal). Approaches that would NOT work: (1) Ignoring bounds—e.g., LLL from start hits col 3 unnecessarily but valid, but too many L (e.g., LLLLLLL) goes to col 1, requiring R corrections (longer). (2) Wrong direction priority—e.g., all D first to row 8, then recover (14+ moves). (3) If walls existed (hypothetical), BFS/A* for shortest path avoiding #; here, naive net-displacement suffices. Generic strategies: Compute deltas (Δrow, Δcol); generate move sequences; validate bounds/obstacles; prefer minimal moves. Extensible: In mazes, prioritize low-obstacle directions; use heuristics like Manhattan distance; explore/backtrack dead ends.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: LLUUUUU (left to align column early, then straight up).

Wall locations (#): row 3 col 3, row 3 col 4, row 5 col 3, row 6 col 3, row 8 col 2, row 11 col 4.\n\nPatterns and constraints: Column 1 is mostly open from row 11 to row 1, with no walls in col 1 at all. Obstacles cluster in columns 3-4 around rows 3-6 and isolated elsewhere. Narrow 4-column width limits maneuvering; cannot go left of col 1 or right of col 4 (out of bounds). Direct vertical path in col 1 from start to goal is unobstructed. Upper rows (1-4) are mostly open except row 3 right side. Lower rows (9-11) open except row 11 col 4.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Goal is directly above start (same column, 3 rows up), so primary direction is up (U). Direct path (UUU) along col 1 is viable as row 7 col 1, row 6 col 1, row 5 col 1 are all passable (- or G).\n\nMultiple paths exist but longer: e.g., go down (D) to row 9 col 1, right (R) to col 2-4, up through col 2 or 4, navigating around row 8 col 2 # by going below it, then left/up to goal. Another: from start, impossible to go right immediately due to wall at row 8 col 2.\n\nBlocked paths: Right from start hits # at (8,2). Any path trying col 3 up from lower rows blocked by # at row 6 col 3 and row 5 col 3. Row 3 col 3-4 # creates a barrier in upper right, trapping if entered carelessly (e.g., up col 4 to row 3 then can't left/up easily).\n\nDead ends/traps: Going down to row 11 col 4 hits #, can't proceed. Over-committing right into row 3 ## dead-ends upward progress. Looping lower right (rows 9-11 cols 2-4) wastes moves without necessity.\n\nApproaches that fail: BFS/DFS without pruning leads to long detours; greedy right/up ignores narrow grid. Ignoring bounds: left from col 1 crashes. Assuming walls everywhere fails as col 1 clear. Not checking vertical first misses shortest path.\n\nGeneric strategies: Mentally map coordinates, prioritize shortest Manhattan distance (here 3 up), verify line-of-sight, enumerate obstacles per column/row. Explore branches breadth-first mentally, prune blocked/impractical. Transferable: decompose grid into lanes (columns), identify chokepoints (# clusters), simulate moves forward/backtrack early.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Direct up column 1 (UUU) - shortest, no obstacles.\n\nStart: row 8, col 1.\n- Move U: navigates around nothing (clear vertical); new position row 7, col 1 (empty -).\n- Move U: continues vertical ascent, avoids distant right walls; new position row 6, col 1 (empty -).\n- Move U: reaches goal, no nearby obstacles to dodge; new position row 5, col 1 (G).\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace:\n1.

All other cells are empty (-), passable except walls.\n\nPatterns and constraints: The grid is mostly open with sparse walls. Column 1 is completely open from row 1 to row 11 (no walls in col 1). Right edge (col 6) has walls at rows 5 and 10, potentially restricting right-side movement near mid and bottom. Wall at (2,3) blocks direct left movement in row 2 past column 4. Wall at (7,2) blocks leftward movement in row 7 at col 2, creating a potential barrier if trying to cross left in that row from the right. Wall at (7,2) does not block col 1.

Then straight down col 1 (fully open corridor, no walls) to goal. This is efficient (13 moves, optimal), uses safe vertical highway in col 1, avoids all walls. Generic extensible strategy: Identify open corridors (e.g., full columns/rows), prioritize bypassing local obstacles early, compute net displacement, verify lanes clear via mental grid scan.

Player starts at row 2, column 7 (@). Goal is at row 3, column 1 (G). Walls (#) are located at row 1 column 9 and row 2 column 9. All other cells are empty (-), passable spaces.\n\nKey patterns and constraints: The grid is mostly open with no obstacles in the central and left areas. The only walls are on the right edge (column 9) in the top two rows, blocking access to the far right in those rows. Player must stay within bounds (rows 1-4, columns 1-9) and cannot land on or pass through walls. No wrapping around edges. Net displacement needed: +1 row (down), -6 columns (left). Paths to the left and center are completely unobstructed.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple possible paths exist due to the open grid: any combination of exactly 6 left (L) moves and 1 down (D) move will reach the goal, as long as intermediate positions avoid the two walls and bounds. For example:\n- All lefts first (to row 2 col 1), then down.\n- Down first (to row 3 col 7), then all lefts.\n- Interleaved, like L D LLLLL, etc.\nAll minimal paths are 7 moves long.\n\nBlocked paths: The walls at (1,9) and (2,9) block rightward progress from the starting area. From start (2,7), R to (2,8) is open, but another R hits (2,9) wall—cannot proceed right further without backtracking. From (2,8), U to (1,8) open, but then R hits (1,9) wall.\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid: Going right leads to a near-dead end at column 9 (row 2 blocked, row 1 blocked), forcing backtrack leftward, wasting moves. No true traps since the grid is open leftward, but rightward exploration is inefficient. Going up (U) from row 2 to row 1 adds extra distance: reaching goal from row 1 requires +2 down moves, making paths at least 9 moves (e.g., U + 6L + 2D). Out-of-bounds moves fail: U from row 1, D from row 4, L from col 1, R from col 9.\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily left (6 steps net), with one down. Stay in rows 2-3 and columns 1-7 to avoid walls/edges.\n\nWhy certain approaches fail:\n- Rightward (R-heavy): Hits walls at col 9, requires backtrack (e.g., RRLLL... inefficient).\n- Upward (U-heavy): Increases row distance to goal (from +1 to +2 or more), longer paths.\n- Boundary hugging wrong side: R to col 9 then down to row 3 col 9 (open), then 8 lefts—9 moves, suboptimal.\n- No pathfinding needed for shortest due to openness, but in general, mentally BFS or check validity per move.\n\nGeneric strategies extensible to other domains: Compute net displacement (Δrow, Δcol). Identify obstacles/bounds as constraints. Prioritize direct moves toward goal (e.g., left/down here). Mentally simulate branches: test primary path, alternatives, and failures. Avoid greedy wrong directions by checking dead ends (e.g., wall proximity). Verify bounds/obstacles per step. For complex grids, enumerate short paths or use A* heuristics (distance to goal).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: 6 lefts to row 2 col 1 (direct left path, all open), then 1 down to goal.

Player starts at (row 5, column 1). Goal at (row 8, column 5). Wall locations: (7,4), (9,1), (10,5), (12,5). All other cells are empty (-). \n\nKey constraints: Must stay within 1-12 rows and 1-5 columns. Walls are impassable. No diagonal moves; only U/D/L/R. Overall displacement needed: +3 rows (down), +4 columns (right). Manhattan distance: 7 moves minimum. Patterns: Grid is mostly open space in upper and middle rows. Walls are sparse but positioned to potentially block direct diagonal progress (e.g., (7,4) obstructs row 7 traversal). Lower walls (rows 9-12) could trap if path overshoots goal, but irrelevant for reaching row 8.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Primary direction is down and right. Shortest path requires exactly 4R and 3D in some order, avoiding walls and bounds. \n\nMultiple paths exist: \n- Right-first along row 5 to column 5 (open), then down column 5 to row 8 (open: row 6 col5 -, row 7 col5 -, row 8 col5 G). \n- Down-first to row 8 column 1 (open), then right along row 8 (all open). \n- Mixed interleaving, e.g., some rights then downs.\n\nBlocked paths: \n- Cannot pass (7,4): Any path through row 7 column 4 fails (e.g., RRR D R D would hit it). \n- Left from start: Out of bounds (column 0 invalid). \n- Excessive up: Moves away from goal, wastes moves, no benefit (rows 1-4 fully open but irrelevant). \n- Down column 1 past row 8: Hits (9,1) wall, potential dead end if trying to loop back.\n\nDead ends/traps: \n- Column 1 rows 9+: Blocked at (9,1), then open but leads to (10,5)# and (12,5)# if drifting right—trap if overshooting goal. \n- Row 7 column 4: Forces detour right to column 5 or left/up. \n- Bottom row 12 column 5: Irrelevant but shows pattern of right-edge blocks.\n\nApproaches that fail and why: \n- Greedy 'always right then down': Works here (RRRRDDD). \n- Greedy 'always down then right': Also works (DDDRRRR), but interleaving needed if walls denser. \n- Random walk: Inefficient, risks dead ends (e.g., going to row 9 col1 blocks left escape). \n- Ignoring bounds: L from (5,1) invalid. \n- Diagonal assumption: Not allowed; must simulate grid steps. \n\nGeneric strategy (extensible): Compute Manhattan distance for lower bound. Visualize/mentally map open corridors (e.g., column 5 open). Prioritize goal direction but check obstacles via forward simulation. Explore alternatives systematically (like BFS: queue positions, avoid visited to prevent loops). Avoid backtracking traps by noting wall clusters. For larger grids: Use A* with heuristic (Manhattan), but here manual enumeration suffices due to small size.\n\nChosen path: Right-first to column 5 (safest corridor), then down—minimal moves, no walls, no bounds issues.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nStart: (5,1)\n- Move R: To (5,2) [row 5 open]\n- Move R: To (5,3) [open]\n- Move R: To (5,4) [open]\n- Move R: To (5,5) [open, navigated right edge]\n- Move D: To (6,5) [row 6 open]\n- Move D: To (7,5) [row 7 col5 open, avoided (7,4)#]\n- Move D: To (8,5) [goal, open]\n\n# Verification\n\nTrace full path RRRRDDD:\n1.

Notable: (5,10) blocks direct leftward travel on row 5 from the right side; (9,8) blocks leftward on row 9 near start; upper-right walls at col 10 in rows 3/5; lower-left walls irrelevant to main path.

General direction: primarily up and left. Optimal paths hug open rows/columns.\n\nBlocked paths:\n- Direct left on row 9 from start: hits (9,8)# after 4 lefts (cols 12→9 ok, 8 blocked).\n- Direct up to row 5 col 12 then left: hits (5,10)# after 2 lefts (col12→11→10#).\n- Straight left then up: limited by (9,8)#, forces early detour up, potentially longer.\n\nDead ends/traps:\n- Lingering near (9,8)# without going up: can trap in bottom-right corner if down/right (hits bounds or row12 walls).\n- Approaching row 5 from right without detour: stuck right of (5,10)#.\n- Unnecessary down moves: risk row 12 walls at cols 2/9, though avoidable.\n\nApproaches that fail and why:\n- Greedy left-first: Hits (9,8)# prematurely, no space to maneuver without backtracking.\n- Greedy up-then-left on row 5: Blocked by (5,10)#, requires backtrack/up/down detour (adds moves).\n- Ignoring walls: Direct Manhattan fails.\n\nGeneric strategies (extensible):\n- Visualize grid mentally or sketch; identify key obstacles blocking primary axis (here, leftward).\n- Prefer open corridors (e.g., row 6 fully open). Check row/column openness.\n- BFS-like mental search: Explore shortest detours around single walls (e.g., dip to adjacent row).\n- Verify net displacement; avoid opposite directions unless necessary.\n- Test alternates: E.g., row 4 detour (up to row 5 col12, left to col11, up to row4 col11, left 7 to col4, down) works but 4U +1L +1U +7L +1D =14 moves (longer). Row 6 detour optimal.\n- Dead-end avoidance: Prioritize paths with multiple exits; flag narrow passages near walls.\n\nChosen strategy: Up 3 to row 6 col12 (open column), left 8 across fully open row 6 to col4, up 1 to goal.

Also ~5 moves (e.g., URRDR to (5,1)-(5,2)-(5,3)-(6,3)-(6,4)).\n\nBlocked paths:\n- Right from start: Blocked by (6,2)#.\n- Left/up/down extremes: Out-of-bounds or into (8,1)# if overextend down from (7,1).\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid:\n- From (7,1), down to (8,1)# invalid—trap if path goes too far down without rightward progress.\n- Row 5 rightward: Hits (5,6)# after col 5; must not continue right blindly.\n- Row 3-4 col 4#: Blocks some upper paths but irrelevant here.\n\nApproaches that fail and why:\n- Greedy right-only: Immediate wall.\n- Up then immediate right to col 6: Hits (5,6)#.\n- Long loops (e.g., to row 9): Wasteful, risks bounds or unnecessary walls.\n- No-lookahead: Might enter dead ends like row 8 col 1.\n\nGeneric strategies: Prioritize shortest detours (minimal out-and-back); explore adjacent rows for full openness (row 7 ideal); mentally simulate 1-2 moves ahead to flag dead ends; consider symmetry/multiple paths for robustness (teaches BFS-like breadth exploration). Favor open rows over cluttered ones (row 7 > row 5). For transfer: In any grid pathfinding, catalog blockers, compute Manhattan + detour cost, prune invalid prefixes.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Detour below via fully open row 7 (shortest, simplest, avoids upper clutter). Why this over above? Row 7 has no walls; zero risk of mid-path blocks.\n\n- Current: (6,1). Move D (down). New: (7,1) empty ('-'). Navigates around (6,2)# by dropping below.\n- Current: (7,1). Move R (right). New: (7,2) empty. Progresses toward goal column.\n- Current: (7,2). Move R. New: (7,3) empty. Continues safely.\n- Current: (7,3). Move R. New: (7,4) empty. Aligned under goal.\n- Current: (7,4). Move U (up). New: (6,4) goal 'G'. Returns to target row.\n\nAlternate explored (for learning): Above path U (5,1), R (5,2), R (5,3), D (6,3 empty), R (6,4). Also 5 moves, accesses row 6 col 3 (open above the blocker). Teaches: Multiple viable detours; pick simplest.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace of solution \"DRRRU\":\n- Start: (6,1)\n- 1.

No clusters of walls or mazes. Key constraints: cannot pass through # walls; must stay within row 1-8 and column 1-11 (out-of-bounds moves invalid). Manhattan distance: |2-1| + |2-8| = 1 down + 6 left = 7 moves minimum. Direct path (left then down or down then left) appears unblocked.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Multiple paths exist due to open grid (e.g., left 6 then down 1, or down 1 then left 6, or detours like down more then up). Paths blocked: None directly block the goal; wall at (3,6) blocks vertical passage at column 6 between row 2-3-4, but irrelevant for goal at row 2. Wall at (8,8) only affects bottom area. Dead ends/traps: Minimal; going right or down excessively (e.g., to row 8) creates long detours but no true dead ends since grid is open. Could trap self by hitting bounds (e.g., left from col 1 or up from row 1). General direction: Primarily left (net 6 columns) and down 1 row. \n\nWhy certain approaches fail:\n- Going up first: Hits row 0 bound, invalid.\n- Going right: Increases distance, no benefit.\n- Ignoring walls and going through (3,6): Invalid move.\n- Zigzagging unnecessarily (e.g., down to row 3 col 7, left to col 6 row 3): Hits wall at (3,6).\n- Going all the way down to row 8 then left/up: Works but inefficient (extra 6 down + 6 up = 12 extra moves), teaches avoiding unnecessary detours.\n\nGeneric strategies (extensible): 1) Compute Manhattan distance for lower bound. 2) Check direct axis-aligned path for obstacles. 3) If blocked, identify minimal detour (e.g., go around wall by 1 cell). 4) Mentally simulate BFS layers or use 'wall-following' in mazes. 5) Prioritize moves reducing Manhattan (greedy heuristic). 6) Explore alternates to confirm no shorter/better. Here, direct path clear, so greedy optimal.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Move left along row 1 to column 2 (avoids any potential row 2 issues, though none exist), then down to goal.

Walls (#) are impassable and located at:\n- Row 2, column 5\n- Row 3, columns 3,4,5,7\n- Row 4, columns 1,3\n- Row 5, columns 1,2\n\nPatterns and constraints: The top row (row 1) is completely open with no walls, allowing free horizontal movement once reached. The starting position is directly below the goal in row 2, column 2, with open space above (row 1, column 2) and to the right (row 1, columns 3 and 4). Lower rows (3-6) form a more complex maze-like structure with clustered walls in row 3 (columns 3-5 and 7) acting as a barrier, and bottom-left walls in rows 4-5 creating potential traps. No walls block direct vertical access upward from start to row 1. Bounds must be respected: cannot go above row 1, below row 6, left of column 1, or right of column 7.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: The goal is immediately above and slightly to the right (up 1 row, right 2 columns net), and row 1 is fully traversable, making upward movement priority. Multiple paths exist: direct 'URR' (up then right twice) or 'RUR' (right, up, right), both length 3. Paths like 'RRU' fail because from row 2 column 4 (after RR), up to row 1 column 4 is goal but skips step-by-step validity—actually 'RRU' goes row2col2 -> R row2col3 (-) -> R row2col4 (-) -> U row1col4 (G), also valid.\n\nBlocked paths: Cannot go right from row 2 column 4 to column 5 (wall at row 2 col 5). Down from start to row 3 column 2 (-) leads into denser walls: row 3 columns 3-5 blocked, forcing detours left/right, but row 4 column 1 and 3 walls, row 5 columns 1-2 walls create dead ends (e.g., bottom-left corner trapped by # at row4col1, row5col1-2). Going left from start to row2col1 then down hits row4col1 # barrier.\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid: Lower maze—e.g., entering row 3 column 6 (-) then right to column 7 (# wall), or down to row 4 column 6 (-), but looping back hits row 3 col7 #. No easy exit back up due to row 3 barriers. General direction: Prioritize 'U' to access open row 1 highway, then 'R' to goal. \n\nApproaches that would NOT work and why: \n- Direct down then loop up: Fails due to row 3 wall cluster blocking efficient north access, leading to longer paths or dead ends (e.g., trapped in bottom by row5 ##). \n- Over-right then up: From row2col4 U to goal works ('RRU'), but further right hits row2col5 #. \n- Looping left/down: Wastes moves, risks bounds or walls (row4col1 #). \n- Ignoring bounds: No issue here, but e.g., LLL from start stays open but away from goal.\n\nGeneric strategies: (1) Parse grid coordinates systematically, list all obstacles upfront. (2) Identify 'highways' (open rows/cols like row 1). (3) Compute Manhattan distance (here |2-1| + |2-4| = 3) as lower bound, seek short paths. (4) Mentally simulate BFS layers: neighbors from start, prune walls/bounds. (5) Consider failure modes: dead ends (surrounded cells), chokepoints (narrow passages). (6) Prioritize goal direction, explore branches but backtrack mentally. Extensible to other domains: Decompose (analyze state/constraints), plan (prioritize directions, prune invalids), simulate/verify step-wise, generalize via patterns (e.g., mazes: walls-up vs open-top).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: URR (direct up to open row 1, then right to goal; shortest, avoids all lower complexity).\n- Current position: row 2, column 2\n- Move U: Navigates around no obstacles (direct up open); New position: row 1, column 2 (- open)\n- Current position: row 1, column 2\n- Move R: Horizontal in open row 1; New position: row 1, column 3 (- open)\n- Current position: row 1, column 3\n- Move R: Continues in open row 1 to goal; New position: row 1, column 4 (G)\n\n# Verification\n\nTrace entire solution step-by-step:\n1.

Dead ends/traps: descending into row 7 left side leads to ## wall, potentially stranding if not careful; row 9 ## blocks middle crossing, creating a trap for low paths trying to loop right then up. General direction: net +2 columns right, 0 net row change, but requires +1/-1 row detour. Upward detour optimal (shortest): row 5 fully open for rightward traversal. Approaches that fail: greedy right/down (immediate walls); staying on row 6 (impossible); over-descending to row 9+ without plan (hits middle wall, forces col 1 or 4 loop, longer ~8+ moves). Generic strategies: systematically enumerate adjacent moves (like BFS for shortest path); identify chokepoints/blockages early; prioritize open adjacent areas; explore alternates/dead ends mentally to build map; consider Manhattan distance adjusted for obstacles; backtrack from dead ends; extensible to mazes/games by chunking local/global planning, avoiding cycles via visited tracking.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: shortest detour up to open row 5, right across to above goal, down (URRD).

Approaches that fail: Going left/up first without compensation (e.g., 5L from start impossible due to col1 bound; or 10U hits row1 then stuck directionally). Pure U or L paths fail to reach goal.

Upper wall at (2,3) blocks direct vertical path through column 3 into row 1, but irrelevant since goal is row 3. No diagonal moves; must stay within bounds (rows 1-8, cols 1-5). Net displacement needed: up 3 rows (decrease row by 3), right 1 column.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple possible paths exist due to open grid: e.g., go right first then up column 4 (RUUU), or up column 3 then right (UUUR), or combinations like U R U U, etc. All minimal paths are 4 moves (Manhattan distance 4). Blocked paths: Direct down from start impossible (row 7 col 3 is wall). Paths venturing down-left (e.g., L D to row 7 col 2) lead to dead ends/traps—row 7 cols 1/3 walled, row 8 col 4 walled, limiting exits to narrow right side (col 5), requiring long detours up (e.g., 10+ moves) to loop back, inefficient and risky for bounds. Straight up column 3 viable but hits wall at row 2 col 3 if over-extend (e.g., UUUU would try row 2 col 3, invalid). Left-heavy paths (e.g., LLUUUU) work but longer (6+ moves), unnecessary. General direction: primarily up (net -3 rows), minor right (+1 col); prioritize column 4 ascent as fully open rows 3-6. Failing approaches: Downward exploration fails due to bottom walls creating cul-de-sac (hard to escape without backtracking up right edge). Over-up in col 3 fails at row 2 wall. Boundary hugging left/top unnecessary. BFS/DFS mentally: shortest paths cluster around central columns; avoid bottom 2 rows entirely.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: RUUU (right then straight up column 4; efficient, avoids all walls, minimal moves).\n- Current position: row 6, col 3.

From row 3 col 3, U to row 2 col 3 (open), but continuing right hits row 2 col 5 #.\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid:\n- Going right into row 3 col 3 leads to a near-dead-end (can backtrack, but U then requires looping left/down to goal, inefficient).\n- Downward from start to row 4 col 2 (open), then can navigate left/up, but creates longer path (e.g., D L U U or similar, 4+ moves) and risks row 4 col 6 wall if going right.\n- Upper-right area (row 2 col 5-6 walls) traps if player moves too far right-up.\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily up (decrease row by 1) and left (decrease column by 1). Avoid right/down detours.\n\nApproaches that would NOT work and why:\n- \"LL\": Left to row 3 col 1 (ok), left again to col 0 (out of bounds).\n- \"UU\": Up to row 2 col 2 (ok), up to row 1 col 2 (open), but overshoots goal and row 1 col 1 wall blocks left.\n- \"R anything short\": R to row 3 col 3, then needs multiple lefts/ups to compensate (e.g., R U L L L, but hits walls or longer).\n- Direct through walls: e.g., trying row 3 col 4 (impassable).\n- Generic failure modes: Ignoring bounds (e.g., L from col 1), assuming G impassable (it's not), greedy right moves into wall clusters.\n\nGeneric strategies extensible to other domains: Use mental BFS/DFS to explore shortest paths first (prioritize minimal moves matching net displacement). Identify Manhattan distance (here 2) as lower bound. Visualize grid mentally or sketch. Prune branches by checking walls/bounds pre-move. Backtrack from dead-ends (e.g., right wall trap). Consider obstacles as forcing left/up priority. For larger grids, heuristics like A* (distance to goal) or wall-avoidance.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: \"LU\" (shortest, direct left then up; \"UL\" also valid but we pick one).\n- Start: row 3, col 2.\n- Move L (left): Navigate around no obstacles (row 3 col 1 is empty -).

Player starts at position (row 5, column 4). Goal is at (row 3, column 7). Walls (#) are located at:\n- Row 1, column 1\n- Row 2, columns 4, 6, 7, 8\n- Row 3, columns 2, 4, 6\n\nAll other cells are passable empty spaces (-), including the goal (G). Key constraints: Moves must stay within bounds (rows 1-5, columns 1-8), cannot pass through walls, and only cardinal directions (U, D, L, R) are allowed—no diagonals. Patterns: Row 3 has walls at even columns 2,4,6, creating a zigzag open path (columns 1,3,5,7,8 open). Row 2 has a wall cluster on the right (columns 6-8) and one at column 4, blocking direct top access from some below positions. Row 4 and 5 are fully open, providing free movement at the bottom. Manhattan distance is |5-3| + |4-7| = 2 up + 3 right = 5 moves minimum.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Need to move net 2 rows up and 3 columns right. Multiple paths exist due to open bottom rows, but obstacles require planning. Blocked paths include:\n- Direct up from start: U to (4,4), U to (3,4)—but (3,4) is wall, dead end.\n- Going left first (e.g., LLL to column 1): Can go up to row 2 column 1, but row 2 columns 6-8 walls block rightward to goal; row 1 column 1 is wall, trapping in top-left corner without access to goal.\n- Trying to go up early at column 4 or 5: Hits row 3 column 4 wall or needs detour.\n\nDead ends/traps: Left side leads to cul-de-sac (can't cross row 2 right walls easily). Right side row 2 walls (6-8) block if trying to go up too far right too soon without using row 3/4. Viable general direction: Move right along open row 5 to column 7, then up through open row 4 column 7 to goal—avoids all walls. Alternate paths: U first to row 4 column 4, then RRR to row 4 column 7, then U (URRRU, also 5 moves). Or go far right to column 8, up, left—but longer (e.g., RRRR U L U, 7 moves). Failing approaches: BFS-like exploration shows left/up combos exceed bounds or hit walls (e.g., from (5,1) UU to (3,1), then right hits row 3 col2 wall). Generic strategy: Compute Manhattan, prioritize open corridors (bottom rows), test first moves (R succeeds, U partial, L risky), backtrack mentally from dead ends, prefer minimal detours. Extensible: Use graph search mindset (each cell node, edges to adjacents if open), heuristic (Manhattan), avoid pruning live paths prematurely.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Go right along row 5 (fully open) to column 7, then up twice through open cells to goal. This hugs the bottom to bypass row 3 walls and row 2 right blocks.\n- Start: (5,4)\n- Move R: To (5,5) (open -)\n- Move R: To (5,6) (open -), navigates around no obstacles yet\n- Move R: To (5,7) (open -), positions directly below ascent path\n- Move U: To (4,7) (open -, row 4 fully open), avoids row 3 col6 wall by not going left/right\n- Move U: To (3,7) (goal G), final ascent clear from below\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace:\n1.

General constraint: must navigate up 4 rows net while staying in bounds (rows 1-6, cols 1-6), avoiding '#'. No diagonal moves; only orthogonal.

General direction: primarily up (net -4 rows), staying near column 6 to avoid walls.

Dead ends/traps: From (6,6), going left to (6,1)-(6,2) leads to open but then up blocked by (5,3)#—forces right detour; row 5 col 1-2 open but (5,3)# traps if go too far left without planning. Upper dead end: row 2 col 2 # blocks direct left to goal if approaching from left. Alternate paths longer, e.g., left to col 4-5 then up around walls (e.g., LLLLUUUUR), but inefficient. Failing approaches: Pure left then up fails due to (5,3)# blocking row 5 cols 1-3 ascent; pure right impossible (out of bounds col 7). BFS/DFS mentally prioritizes shortest: column 6 direct. Avoid greedily up-left (hits walls); backtracking needed for detours.

Key constraints: Sparse walls create an open grid with minor blockages—top-right corner partially blocked by (1,5), bottom-left corner obstructed by (5,1) and (7,1), and a stray wall at (6,6). No full barriers divide the grid; paths exist freely in the center. Patterns: Vertical movement is mostly unimpeded upward from start to goal; horizontal walls are localized, forcing minor detours only if moving extremely left or right at bottom/top.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple possible paths exist due to open space; shortest paths are Manhattan distance (4 up + 2 left = 6 moves), with many variants (e.g., interleave U and L).

Dead ends/traps: Venturing down to row 6-7 leads to cul-de-sacs—e.g., row 7 col 1 is wall, col 2-6 open but requires backtracking up, wasting moves; row 6 col 6 wall blocks right edge. Avoid by prioritizing upward momentum. Alternate paths: (1) Left-first (LLUUUU): Stays left column early, safe as col 2 is open vertically. (2) Up-first (UUUULL): Hits top row at col 4 (open), then left—avoids top wall. (3) Mixed (e.g., UULLUU): Also 6 moves. Longer paths: Right-first (e.g., RR then up/left) adds detours past col 6 edge.

Lower rows form a cul-de-sac on the left-bottom with walls blocking upward escapes except back to start. Right side has isolated cells like (2,4) and (3,5)/(4,5) unreachable due to surrounding walls. Pathfinding must prioritize reaching the open top row without entering dead-end bottom areas.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Primary goal requires moving up (to row 1) and right (to column 5). Direct path: up from start to row 1 col 2 (open), then right x3 across open top row. Multiple paths exist but most are longer or circuitous; e.g., down to bottom then back up retraces to start, effectively looping without progress toward goal.\n\nBlocked paths: Cannot move right from start (wall at 2,3); cannot left (wall 2,1). Downward paths lead to dead ends:\n- Down to (3,2), right to (3,3): up blocked (wall 2,3), right blocked (3,4), down to (4,3) leads to left-bottom loop (walls at 3,1 and 4,4 prevent escape/upward to right/top).\n- Bottom-left area (rows 3-4, cols 1-3) is a trap: no upward path to row 2 cols 1-3 except back through (3,2) to start; walls at (3,1) and (2,1) seal it off.\n- Right-side cells like (2,4) unreachable (blocked left by 2,3, right 2,5, down 3,4); (3,5) isolated (left 3,4 wall, up 2,5 wall).\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid: Any downward move from start enters bottom trap requiring backtrack (U from 3,2), wasting moves. No path from bottom reaches goal without returning to start first.\n\nGeneral direction: Up 1, right 3 (net displacement: -1 row, +3 cols). Approaches that fail: Right-first (immediate wall); down-first (traps goal behind walls); left/down explorations (bounds/walls). Generic strategy: Mentally simulate BFS/DFS short paths, prioritize open corridors (top row), mark dead ends (bottom-left cul-de-sac), test alternates by enumerating moves from positions. Extensible: Identify 'open highways' (top row), avoid 'cul-de-sacs' by checking exit paths before entering, compute Manhattan distance (here 1+3=4) as lower bound, verify no obstacles on geodesic.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Direct up to top row, then right along open path (shortest, avoids all traps).\n- Current: row 2 col 2. Move U. New: row 1 col 2 (empty, navigates around implicit left/right walls in row 2).\n- Current: row 1 col 2. Move R. New: row 1 col 3 (empty, top row open).\n- Current: row 1 col 3. Move R. New: row 1 col 4 (empty, continuing right).\n- Current: row 1 col 4. Move R. New: row 1 col 5 (goal, open path).\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace:\n1. Start: row 2 col 2 (valid, empty after move-out).\n2. U → row 1 col 2 (bounds ok, empty - , no wall).\n3. R → row 1 col 3 (bounds ok, empty - , no wall).\n4. R → row 1 col 4 (bounds ok, empty - , no wall).\n5. R → row 1 col 5 (bounds ok, goal G, no wall).\n\nEnd at goal. No walls hit (all moves to - or G). All within 1-4 rows, 1-5 cols. No errors; alternates like inserting D/U loops verified invalid (e.g., from row 1 col 2 D back to 2,2 wastes moves). Path optimal (4 moves, matches Manhattan).\n\n# Solution\n\nURRR</think>\n\n{\"solution\": \"URRR\"}"}],"llmPathLength":4}

Prioritize boundary/open areas to avoid interior mazes. Enumerate short-term options, simulate 1-2 moves ahead to spot blocks.

Player starts at row 9, column 4 (@). Goal is at row 3, column 1 (G). Walls (#) are located at: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), and (8,2). All other cells are empty (-). Key patterns: a vertical wall barrier in column 3 from rows 4-6 blocks upward passage through the middle of the grid; a single wall in row 8, column 2 blocks ascent in column 2 from below row 8. The grid is very narrow (only 4 columns), forcing path choices to hug the left (col 1) or right (col 4) edges to bypass obstacles. Constraints: moves only U/D/L/R (no diagonals); cannot pass # or exit bounds (rows 1-11, cols 1-4); minimum moves needed is Manhattan distance of 6 up + 3 left = 9 moves.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple viable paths exist due to open columns 1 and 4. Primary strategies: (1) Move up column 4 to row 3, then left to column 1 (stays right of central barrier); (2) Move left to column 1, then up to row 3 (stays left edge). Both are 9 moves, optimal. Blocked paths: column 3 is impassable upward beyond row 7 due to # at (6,3)-(4,3); cannot cross the barrier without going around. Column 2 ascent from bottom is trapped by # at (8,2)--cannot move U from row 9 col 2 to row 8 col 2. Dead ends/traps: Entering column 3 at row 9, moving up to row 7 col 3 leads to # at row 6 col 3; must backtrack left/right. Similarly, row 9 col 2 up hits # immediately. General direction: primarily 6U and 3L in some order, prioritizing open corridors. Failing approaches: (1) Straight up column 3 fails at row 6 #, wasting moves and risking deeper trap if not backtracking; (2) Up column 2 fails immediately at row 8 #; (3) Unnecessary down moves lead to bottom dead ends (rows 10-11 open but no progress); (4) Right from col 4 out-of-bounds invalid; (5) Zigzagging through col 3 mid-grid impossible due to barrier. Generic strategies: Identify chokepoints (barriers), prioritize edge paths in narrow spaces, mentally simulate columns for openness, compute min distance to validate optimality, explore dead ends preemptively to avoid in solution.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Up column 4 to bypass central barrier, then left across row 3 (open: G--- all passable to G).\n- Current: (9,4); U; New: (8,4); row 8 col 4 empty, avoids nearby # at (8,2).\n- Current: (8,4); U; New: (7,4); row 7 all empty.\n- Current: (7,4); U; New: (6,4); navigates around # at (6,3) by staying col 4.\n- Current: (6,4); U; New: (5,4); avoids # at (5,3).\n- Current: (5,4); U; New: (4,4); avoids # at (4,3).\n- Current: (4,4); U; New: (3,4); reaches target row, row 3 col 4 empty.\n- Current: (3,4); L; New: (3,3); row 3 col 3 empty.\n- Current: (3,3); L; New: (3,2); row 3 col 2 empty.\n- Current: (3,2); L; New: (3,1); reaches G.\nThis avoids all traps by committing to open col 4 first.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace:\n1.

Key constraints include: wall immediately right of start at (3,2) blocks initial right moves; central wall at (5,5) obstructs direct vertical or diagonal progress through row 5 at column 5; peripheral walls at (4,11) and (9,3) limit far-right top and bottom-left access but do not block primary paths. Manhattan distance is 4 down + 4 right = 8 moves minimum, but walls require careful ordering to avoid blocks.

Generic strategy: Mentally map obstacles as 'blockers' and plan bypasses (left/around/below); use 'lookahead' (simulate 1-2 moves ahead); prefer interleaving moves matching net displacement; extensible to pathfinding (BFS for shortest, A* with heuristic); decompose into subgoals (e.g., 'reach row 4', 'bypass (5,5)', 'align to goal column').

Alternate: Down-first to row 6 col 5, left to col 1 avoiding row 5 col 2, then down—but longer due to detour.\n- Failing approaches:\n  - Straight down to row 7 col 5 (LLLL blocked by row 7 col 2 #).\n  - Upward exploration (row 1 walls trap).\n  - Bottom loop via row 9 (## blocks, extra distance).\nGeneric strategies: Mentally map columns/rows for clear lanes (e.g., col 1 open vertically). Prioritize shortest paths via Manhattan but validate wall-free. Explore branches: simulate 1-2 moves ahead, backtrack mentally on blocks. Avoid greedy (e.g., always left/down) by checking endpoint access. Extensible: In other domains (e.g., mazes, routing), identify 'chokepoints' (walls near goal), pre-check axes (vertical/horizontal lanes), use 'safe corridor' prioritization over blind search.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Left to col 1 on row 2 (open), then down col 1 to goal (clear lane).

Column 6 is completely open from row 7 up to row 2 (no walls in col 6 rows 2-7). Row 2 is entirely open (passable cells only). Row 1 is open but not needed.

G is passable.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Primary direction is up (net -5 rows) and left (net -5 cols). Multiple paths exist, but many lead to dead ends due to walls. Optimal strategy: Identify open vertical corridors first (e.g., col 6 is fully open from row 7 to row 2), then horizontal traversal on open rows (row 2 fully open). This minimizes turns and backtracking.\n\nBlocked paths:\n- Left along row 7: Hits wall at row7 col1 after 4L (from col6 to col2 open, col1 #). Dead end; can't proceed up immediately from bottom-left.\n- Right to col7 then up: From row7 col7 open, row6 col7 open, but row5 col7 # blocks further up. Trap; forces backtrack.\n- Up col5: row7 col5 open, but row6 col5 # blocks up to row5 col5.\n- Up col7 partial, as above.\n- Left-up zigzag on left side: row8 col1 open but row8 col2 #; row7 col1 #; row6 col1 open but narrow path squeezed by row5 col2 # and row3 col2 #, requiring detours.\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid: Bottom-right corner (row7-8 col7) leads nowhere up; left-bottom blocked by row7 col1 # and row8 col2 #; mid-right col7 walls (rows3-5) create cul-de-sac. Avoid hugging walls; scan for full vertical paths.\n\nWhy certain approaches fail:\n- Greedy left-first: Hits row7 col1 #, no up path without backtrack >10 moves.\n- BFS shortsighted (local max): Might go right/up into col7 trap, wasting moves.\n- No global scan: Misses col6 highway.\n\nGeneric strategies: (1) Map open corridors (vertical/horizontal lines without #). (2) Prioritize net direction (here up>left). (3) Simulate short paths first. (4) Identify dead ends by tracing walls to bounds. (5) Verify multi-step previews. Extensible: In pathfinding/AI, use column/row scans (like A* heuristic), prune blocked subpaths early, prefer low-obstacle density areas.

Player starts at row 8, column 4 (@). Goal is at row 11, column 3 (G). Wall locations: row 1 column 3 (#), row 4 column 1 (#). All other cells are empty (-).\n\nKey patterns and constraints: The grid is mostly open space with only two isolated walls in the upper section (top-rightish and top-left). No walls obstruct the lower half where the player and goal reside (rows 7-12). Player needs to move down 3 rows (from row 8 to 11) and left 1 column (from column 4 to 3). The narrow 4-column width limits lateral movement but no blocks prevent navigation. Bounds: Cannot move outside rows 1-12 or columns 1-4. Walls are impassable.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: The general direction is primarily down (net +3 rows) with a minor left shift (-1 column), totaling a minimum of 4 moves (3D + 1L in any order). Multiple paths exist due to open space: direct downs then left (DDDL), interleave like DDLD or DLDD, or detours like going left first then down. All lower paths are viable since rows 8-12, columns 1-4 are fully empty.\n\nBlocked paths: Walls are irrelevant here (upper grid only). No blocks between start and goal. If detouring upward (e.g., UUU), could hit walls: from row 8 col 4 up to row 5 col 4 (open), row 4 col 4 (open), but row 4 col 1 blocks leftward there; row 1 col 3 blocks center-top. Going up leads away from goal, wasting moves.\n\nDead ends/traps: None in lower grid—fully connected open space. Potential pseudo-dead-end: Hitting right bound (col 4, cannot R), or left bound (col 1, cannot L further), but can always backtrack down/left as needed. No loops or traps due to acyclic downward flow.\n\nApproaches that fail and why:\n- All-up (UUU): Moves to row 5 col 4, away from goal (+3 up instead of down), hits upper walls if left (row 4 col 1 # blocks col 1 down from row 3), requires doubling back (inefficient).\n- All-left first (LLL): From col 4 to col 1 row 8 (open), but still needs 3D; no issue but longer if unnecessary.\n- Right moves (R): Impossible from col 4 (out of bounds).\n- Staying horizontal: No progress down to row 11.\nBFS/DFS mentally: Shortest paths ~4 moves; greedy down-first efficient here.\n\nChosen strategy: Direct down to row 11 col 4 (DDDL), then left—minimal moves, avoids any upper detours.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nStart: row 8, col 4.\n- Move 1: D → row 9, col 4 (empty, progresses down; no obstacles).\n- Move 2: D → row 10, col 4 (empty, continues down).\n- Move 3: D → row 11, col 4 (empty, reaches goal row; col 4 safe before left).\n- Move 4: L → row 11, col 3 (G, navigates minor left shift; row 11 fully open).\n\nThis avoids walls (none nearby), stays in bounds, efficient.\n\nAlternate explored: DLDD (D to 9,4; L to 9,3 empty; D 10,3 empty; D 11,3 G)—also works, interleaves safely. DDLD similar. Upward detour (e.g., U D D D L) wasteful but possible.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace starting row 8 col 4:\n1. D → row 9 col 4 (row 9: ---- empty; in bounds).\n2.

L → row 11 col 3 (row 11 col 3: G; no wall; in bounds col 1-4).\n\nFinal: row 11 col 3 (G). No walls hit (path avoids row 1/4 #s). All moves valid (no out-of-bounds: rows 8→11 ≤12, cols 4→3 ≥1 ≤4). No errors.\n\nGeneric strategies extensible: (1) Identify net displacement (Δrow +3, Δcol -1). (2) Check local openness vs. obstacles. (3) Prioritize goal direction, explore detours only if blocked. (4) Verify bounds/walls per move. (5) Consider shortest vs. safe paths.

Player starts at row 3, column 7 (@). Goal at row 1, column 10 (G). Single wall (#) at row 4, column 6. All other cells are empty (-). Key constraints: cannot pass through # or go out of bounds (rows 1-4, columns 1-10). Patterns: mostly open space, wall only blocks bottom-middle area (row 4, col 6), irrelevant for direct up-right path to goal but could trap detours downward-left. Manhattan distance: 2 up + 3 right = 5 moves minimum, no obstacles on shortest paths.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nGeneral direction: primarily up (net 2 rows) and right (net 3 columns) to goal. Multiple viable paths exist due to open grid:\n- Path A: Right-first (RRRUU): Moves right along row 3 to col 10, then up row 10 to goal.\n- Path B: Up-first (UURRR): Moves up along col 7 to row 1, then right along row 1 to goal.\n- Hybrids like URURU also work but same length.\n\nBlocked paths: None on shortest routes. Wall at (4,6) blocks leftward on row 4 past col 6 or down from row 3 col 6/7-left. Dead ends/traps: Going down (D) from start to (4,7) leads to partial cul-de-sac—can move right freely on row 4 (cols 7-10 empty), but left to (4,6) blocked, forcing backtrack if goal-seeking left/down. Going left (L) extensively (e.g., LLLLLL to col 1 on row 3) creates long detour, requiring extra rights later; wastes moves. Out-of-bounds fails: e.g., RRRR from col 7 hits col 11 invalid; UUU from row 3 hits row 0.\n\nApproaches that fail:\n- Downward exploration: D then L hits wall quickly, no progress to goal (goal is up-right).\n- Leftward detours: Increases path length unnecessarily (e.g., L then compensate with extra R).\n- Ignoring bounds: Over-right/up leads to invalid moves.\n- Greedy 'always up/right' works here but generically fails with obstacles (use here as proxy for A* or BFS: prioritize low-cost, low-obstacle directions).\n\nGeneric strategies: Compute Manhattan distance for heuristic. Explore BFS mentally for shortest path (queue positions by distance). Avoid backtracking traps by preferring goal-direction moves. Prune dead ends (e.g., wall-adjacent or bound-proximal without escape). Transferable: In mazes/games, rank moves by {goal proximity, obstacle distance, bound safety}; simulate 1-2 steps ahead for branches.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen: Right-first (RRRUU)—balances exploration, avoids premature up into potential top traps (none here). Alternatives like UURRR equivalent.\n- Start: (3,7)\n- R: to (3,8), navigates open row 3 rightward.\n- R: to (3,9), continues right, open.\n- R: to (3,10), reaches east edge, open.\n- U: to (2,10), up open col 10.\n- U: to (1,10) G, reaches goal, open.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace for RRRUU:\n1.

Patterns/constraints: Top-left corner blocked by two walls at row 0 cols 0-1 and a wall protruding at (1,2), creating a barrier preventing easy upward or leftward navigation from start without care. Open space in the middle (rows 2-3 fully open) and bottom partially open but with walls at (4,0) and (5,3), so path must approach goal from right or above, avoiding left-bottom trap at (4,0). Overall, mostly open but walls funnel path downward then leftward to goal.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nGeneral direction needed: Primarily down (increase row from 2 to 4) and slightly left (column 2 to 1), minimal rightward deviation. Multiple paths exist: shortest direct down-left-down; longer via left side (e.g., left twice, down, right, down) or right side (right, down, left twice, down).

Dead ends/traps: Top-right corner (rows 0-1 cols 3) is open but walled off from goal by (1,2), leading to no-progress loop; extreme left column down from row 2 col 0 leads to (4,0) wall, trapping if no right move; bottom-right (5,3) wall irrelevant but bounds check needed. Approaches that fail: Pure left then down (LLDD) hits (4,0) wall; pure down-right (DRDD) overshoots left need and hits bounds or unnecessary; upward exploration wastes moves and dead-ends due to top walls.

Wall locations: row 2 column 3 (#), row 3 column 7 (#), row 4 columns 2-4 (###).\n\nPatterns and constraints: The grid is mostly open space with isolated walls creating local blockages. The wall at (2,3) blocks row 2 left of column 3. The wall at (3,7) blocks row 3 at column 7. The ### in row 4 columns 2-4 creates a narrow passage on the bottom left. Moves are only U/D/L/R (no diagonals). Must stay within bounds (rows 1-4, columns 1-12); walls are impassable. Manhattan distance: 1 row up + 5 columns left = 6 moves minimum. Generic strategy: Explicitly map start, goal, and all obstacles; note irrelevant obstacles (e.g., left-side walls don't block right-side path to goal).\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily left (5 columns) with one up move. Multiple viable paths exist, including: (1) left along row 2 to column 6, then up (LLLLLU); (2) up to row 1 column 11, then left (ULLLLL). Both are 6 moves, shortest possible, and avoid all walls entirely since row 1 and row 2 (columns 4-12) are fully open in the relevant area.\n\nBlocked paths: Cannot traverse row 2 left of column 3 due to # at (2,3). Cannot pass row 3 column 7 due to # there. Row 4 passage narrows after column 4.\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid: Overshooting left on row 2 to (2,4), then attempting left hits (2,3)#—leads to detour down to row 3, but then row 3 column 7 # forces further detour (e.g., down to row 4), creating a long maze-like path (20+ moves). Going right from start hits column 12 bound quickly, no progress toward goal. Going down first to row 3 column 11, then left, hits (3,7)# after 4 left moves—forcing down to row 4 col 8, left past ### (viable but navigates narrow gap at row 4 col 5+), then up—much longer (~12-15 moves) and riskier for bounds/errors.\n\nWhy certain approaches fail: Greedy 'always left then up' works here but fails if goal were left of column 3 (hits wall, needs detour planning). Pure down-left fails due to (3,7)# trap.

No walls in top rows or left column upward path. Player needs net 5 moves Up (row 6 to 1) and 4 moves Right (col 1 to 5).

Both minimal length 9 moves (5U + 4R net). Blocked paths: Right edge (Col 8) traps player—Row 6 Col 8 open, but Up to Row 5 Col 8 hits #; further Up blocked by Row 3 Col 8 #. Mid-blockers like Row 4 Col 4 force detours if crossing early. Dead ends/traps: Going Down from Row 6 (blocked at start by Row 7 Col 1 #; from Col 2+ leads to Row 9, far from goal, requiring backtrack). Bottom row (Row 8/9) has # at Col 5/7, creating pockets (e.g., Row 8 Col 6 isolated-ish). General direction: Primarily Up (5 net), Right (4 net); prioritize upward progress while aligning column. Failing approaches: (1) Right-first to Col 8 then Up—hits multiple # on right, dead end requiring left/backtrack (inefficient). (2) Up-first in Col 1 but then Down/Right prematurely—risks Row 7 Col 1 # or Row 8 #s. (3) Zigzagging through center ignores safe corridors, risks Row 4 Col 4 #.

Player starts at row 3, column 3 (@). Goal is at row 7, column 6 (G). Wall locations: There are NO walls (#) anywhere on the grid; it is completely open with only empty cells (-), the player, and the goal. Key constraints: All moves must stay within bounds (rows 1-9, columns 1-9). No impassable obstacles, so any path that respects bounds is valid. Patterns: Fully open space allows direct Manhattan-distance pathfinding. Required displacement: +4 rows down, +3 columns right (total minimum 7 moves). No chokepoints, loops, or barriers.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Since the grid is obstacle-free, countless paths exist (any sequence of 4 D and 3 R, plus optional detours that return). Shortest paths are exactly 7 moves (4D + 3R in any order). Multiple possible paths: e.g., all rights first then downs (RRRDDDD), all downs first then rights (DDDDRRR), or interleaved (e.g., DRDRDRDD). No paths are blocked as there are no walls. Dead ends or traps: None exist; the only 'traps' are self-imposed by going out of bounds (e.g., >3 U from start hits row 0, or >6 D from start hits row 9+). General direction needed: Primarily down (to increase row from 3 to 7) and right (to increase column from 3 to 6); net +4 down, +3 right. Avoid unnecessary up/left to minimize moves, but detours are possible if they stay in bounds.\n\nWhy certain approaches would fail:\n- Going excessively up (e.g., UUUUU): Hits row 0 (out of bounds after 3 U from row 3).\n- Going excessively left (e.g., LLL): Hits column 0 (out of bounds after 3 L from col 3).\n- Going excessively down/right without balance: e.g., DDDDDDD reaches row 10 (invalid), but since we need exactly +4D/+3R, overdoing leads to bounds violation if not corrected.\n- Loops or zigzags that exit bounds: e.g., RRRRRRRR (col 11 invalid).\n- Approaches that work but inefficiently: Long detours like going to (1,1) then back (many extra U/L then compensating D/R), but valid if in bounds. BFS or A* (Manhattan heuristic |Δrow| + |Δcol|) ideal for shortest path in open grid; greedy (always toward goal) also works here.\n\nExtensible strategies: Compute Manhattan distance for lower bound. Prioritize moves reducing distance (prefer D/R here). Simulate paths mentally or via search, pruning invalid (bounds/walls). In walled grids, this transfers to avoiding # via backtracking or exploring branches.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Go right-first to column 6 (align horizontally), then down to row 7. This keeps movement structured, avoids any potential bound issues early, and is shortest (7 moves). Alternatives like down-first also work but this hugs the top/middle initially.\n\n- Start: row 3, col 3\n- Move R → row 3, col 4 (empty, toward goal col)\n- Move R → row 3, col 5 (empty)\n- Move R → row 3, col 6 (empty, now horizontally aligned)\n- Move D → row 4, col 6 (empty, toward goal row)\n- Move D → row 5, col 6 (empty)\n- Move D → row 6, col 6 (empty)\n- Move D → row 7, col 6 (goal G reached)\n\nObstacles navigated: None (open grid), but this path stays far from left/top bounds (min col 3→6, min row 3, max row 7, all safe).\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace:\n1.

Boundaries are strict: cannot move outside rows 1-11 or columns 1-9. Patterns/constraints: The grid is mostly open with only two walls in column 1 (rows 6 and 10), creating a minor blockage in the leftmost column but no issues for paths in columns 2+. The player needs to move generally up (decrease row by 6) and slightly left (from column 3 to 2). No wrapping around edges.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist due to the open grid. Primary direction: up 6 steps and left 1 step, in flexible order. Optimal/shortest paths are 7 moves (6U + 1L). Paths blocked: Any path relying solely on column 1 upward from row 9 would hit the wall at row 6 column 1 (e.g., L L to column 1 row 9, then UUUUUU fails at row 6). Dead ends/traps: None major, but lingering in column 1 below row 6 or around row 10 column 1 wastes moves or risks bounds. Going right/down first is inefficient (increases distance). Approaches that fail: (1) Ignoring walls and going left-up in column 1: blocked at row 6 col 1. (2) Over-right (e.g., RRR then up): works but longer (extra lefts needed later). (3) Down first: moves away from goal, potential to hit row 10 col 1 wall or row 11 bound. Best strategy: Minimal deviation—left once early, then straight up column 2 (fully open). Alternate: Up first to row 6 col 3, left to col 2, then up (avoids nothing but equivalent length).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: L then 6U (stays in safe column 2). \n- Start: row 9, col 3.

Patterns/constraints: A cluster of walls in row 3 cols 2-4 blocks upper-middle passage; isolated wall at row 6 col 3 directly blocks rightward movement from start; row 9 col 2 creates a minor lower blockage; upper-left corner walled off (rows 1-2 col 1); most of lower grid (rows 5-8) is open except noted walls. Direct line from start to goal requires moving down 2 rows and right 3 columns, but row 6 col 3 wall forces a detour.

Multiple paths exist due to open lower grid (rows 5-8 mostly empty). Blocked paths: Direct RR from start hits # at (6,3); upper paths through row 3 cols 2-4 blocked by wall cluster, requiring detour left/right but longer (e.g., up to row 5, right across open row 5 to col 6, down around—but adds 10+ moves unnecessarily). Dead ends/traps: Row 9 col 2 # traps if enter row 9 col 1 (must backtrack up); upper-left corner (rows 1-2 col 1 #s) is a cul-de-sac. Avoid upward moves initially as goal is below; shortest paths ~5 moves via lower detour. Failing approaches: Greedy right-first fails at (6,3) #; down-too-far to row 9 col 1 then right blocked, forces backtrack; upper loop (e.g., U RRRR D etc.) works but inefficient (15+ moves), teaches avoiding distractions from goal direction.

Row 2 is mostly open (cols 1-7 empty, col 8 wall). Row 3 has walls at col 2 and col 7, with goal at col 3 accessible from above or right/below. Rows 4-6 are largely open but with isolated walls. No diagonal moves; must stay in bounds (rows 1-6, cols 1-8). Manhattan distance: 2 down + 3 left = 5 moves minimum. Key chokepoints: wall at (1,3) forces detour down; walls at col 2 in rows 3-4 block left-side access to goal.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist: shortest ~5 moves via row 2 leftward then down; alternatives include going down to row 3 first then left (also 5 moves), or looping via bottom rows (much longer, 10+ moves). Paths blocked: direct left on row 1 hits (1,3) wall after 2 lefts. Dead ends/traps: row 1 col 8 (open but right edge leads to row 2 col 8 wall or out-of-bounds); row 3 col 7 wall blocks right-side down from row 2 col 7; row 6 col 7 wall could trap if navigating bottom-right unnecessarily.\n\nGeneral direction: primarily down (net +2 rows) and left (net -3 cols). Approaches that fail: (1) Staying on row 1 leftward -- blocked by (1,3), forces backtrack (wastes moves). (2) Going right/up first -- up out-of-bounds, right detours away from goal, hits edges/walls (e.g., R R from start to (1,8), then D to (2,8)# invalid). (3) Bottom loop (D to row 6, left, up) -- viable but inefficient, risks row 6 col 7 wall if not careful. (4) Ignoring bounds/walls -- e.g., L L L from start hits wall. Best strategy: detour down to open row 2, move left unobstructed, then down to goal. Generic lesson: compute Manhattan for lower bound; identify/avoid local blocks (visualize 'funnel' paths around obstacles); prioritize open corridors; mentally simulate BFS layers or A* heuristics (favor goal direction) for efficiency; explore dead ends preemptively to teach pruning.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: DLLLD (down row 2 corridor, left to align with goal column, down to goal).\n- Start: (1,6)\n- D: to (2,6) -- row 2 col 6 empty; navigates around row 1 col 3 wall by dropping to open row 2.\n- L: to (2,5) -- empty; progressing left.\n- L: to (2,4) -- empty.\n- L: to (2,3) -- empty; now directly above goal, avoiding row 3 col 2 wall to the left.\n- D: to (3,3) -- goal; enters from above, bypassing side walls.\n\nAlternate explored: LLDDD (left on row 1 to (1,4), down to row 2/3, left) -- hits near (1,3) dead end vibe but workable, same length; DDLLL (down to row 3 col 6, left) -- also 5 moves, avoids row 2 entirely but hits nothing.

All other cells are empty (-).\n\nKey patterns and constraints: The grid is very narrow (only 4 columns), limiting lateral movement. The player and goal are in the same column (col 4), suggesting a primarily downward path. Walls are concentrated in lower rows (6+), particularly blocking left side (cols 1-2 in rows 6 and 8, col 3 in rows 10-11), but col 4 appears open from row 1 to 11. No walls block col 4 in rows 1-5. Bounds constraints: Cannot move outside rows 1-11 or cols 1-4; walls are impassable. Manhattan distance is 4 (down), indicating minimum 4 moves needed.

Must stay within bounds (rows 0-4, columns 0-10). Net movement needed: +1 row (down), +2 columns (right) from start. Manhattan distance: 3 moves minimum.\nPatterns: Mostly open grid with isolated walls on the right side (column 8). No full barriers; direct paths possible. Walls at (2,8) blocks immediate right of goal; (4,8) irrelevant for shortest paths but could trap long detours downward.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Shortest paths require exactly 2 rights (R) and 1 down (D) in some order. Possible shortest sequences: RRD, RDR, DRR. All feasible as they avoid walls.\nMultiple paths: \n- Row 1 is fully open (all -), allowing free left/right movement.\n- Row 2 open from col 0-7 and 9-10 (only # at col 8).\n- Rows 0,3 fully open; row 4 open except col 8.\nBlocked paths: Cannot go right from goal to (2,8) #. Cannot enter (4,8) #. No paths blocked to goal itself.\nDead ends/traps: Minimal in this open grid. Potential trap: Going down to row 4 and right toward col 8 hits #, requiring backtrack (e.g., from (4,7) R blocked). Over-right on row 1 to col 10 then down forces leftward detour. Up to row 0 adds unnecessary distance.\nGeneral direction: Primarily right (+2 col) and slightly down (+1 row). Prioritize staying near goal's row/column to minimize moves.\nApproaches that fail and why:\n- Direct down-right but overshooting: e.g., RRR from start to (1,8), then D to (2,8) # -- hits wall, dead end requiring backtrack (wastes moves).\n- Going left/up first: e.g., LLLUU -- moves away from goal, increases distance, no obstacles but inefficient (extensible lesson: always consider net vector to goal).\n- Down to row 4 first: DDD to (4,5), then RR to (4,7), U to (3,7), U to (2,7) -- works but 6 moves vs 3, hits no walls but inefficient; trying R from (4,7) to (4,8) # fails.\n- Ignoring bounds: R 6 times from start hits col 10 edge, cannot go further right without down/up.\nGeneric strategies: Compute Manhattan distance ( |Δrow| + |Δcol| ) for lower bound. Visualize/mentally simulate grid or sketch. Check obstacles in bounding box (rows 1-2, cols 5-7: all clear). Explore permutations of minimal moves. Use BFS thinking: prioritize adjacent to goal. Avoid backtracking by checking forward paths. Transferable: In mazes, mark visited to prevent loops; here open so not needed but good habit.\nChosen path: RRD -- stays high (row 1 open), direct to above goal, then down.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nStart at (1,5).\n1. Move R: From (1,5) to (1,6). Row 1 col 6 is '-', open. Navigates right toward goal column.\n2. Move R: From (1,6) to (1,7). Row 1 col 7 is '-', open. Now directly above goal.\n3.

The wall at (3,3) is off to the left-up and does not block primary paths down. The critical wall is at (11,8), directly adjacent to the goal on the right in row 11, creating a partial barrier near the goal.

Manhattan distance is 9 moves, but obstacles may require detours.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Multiple paths exist due to open space, but shortest paths are 9 moves (8D + 1L in some order). General direction: primarily down (to row 12), slightly left (to col 7 from 8). \n\n- Paths blocked: Cannot pass through any #.

Near goal, row 12 col 8/9 are open but require extra left moves.\n\n- Alternate paths: (1) L first to col 7 row 4, then 8D straight down col 7 (all open). (2) 6D to row 10 col 8, L to row 10 col 7, 2D to goal (avoids row 11 col 8 #). (3) More complex: R to col 9, down all way (open), then Lx2 at bottom (longer, 8D +1R +2L =11 moves). Going up first (e.g., U to row 3 col 8) then down loops wastefully.\n\n- Why certain approaches fail: Pure 8D fails (hits row 11 col 8 # after 7D). Pure 1L +8D works but only if L before descending past row 10 in col 8. BFS-like mental search prioritizes down-left; greedy down-only traps at row 10 col 8 needing correction. Generic strategy: Identify chokepoints (row 11 col 8), compute Manhattan, test simple reorderings of moves, visualize key obstacles relative to straight-line path.

Bottom row and goal row are fully passable left-to-right except (4,5).\n- General direction: Prioritize leftward progress while navigating around (4,5) by moving left at least 1 before any up. Avoid backtracking.\n- Why certain approaches fail: Greedy 'up first' fails due to local obstacle (teaches need for lookahead). BFS/DFS mentally: Explore neighbors, prune invalid/out-of-bounds. Random walks inefficient; shortest path via obstacle-aware Manhattan. Generic strategy: Identify blockers (here column-5 walls), find minimal detour (shift left before up), verify bounds. Extensible to mazes: Use wall-following (e.g., left-hand rule) or A* heuristic (distance to goal).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: LLLLU (bottom-then-up; simple, teaches clear sequencing). Alternatives like LULLL also work but this avoids row 4 until end.\n\n- Start: (5,5)\n- Move 1: L to (5,4) -- empty, navigates along open bottom row, avoids future wall.\n- Move 2: L to (5,3) -- empty, continues leftward progress.\n- Move 3: L to (5,2) -- empty, halfway to left edge.\n- Move 4: L to (5,1) -- empty, reaches left column, now safe to go up.\n- Move 5: U to (4,1) -- goal G, no obstacle as (4,1) is open (G).\n\nThis executes minimal moves, prioritizing obstacle avoidance.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace:\n1.

Player starts at row 1, column 9 (@). Goal at row 4, column 1 (G). Wall locations: (1,8), (2,2), (4,8), (5,7), (8,4). All other cells are empty (-).\n\nPatterns and constraints: The grid is mostly open with sparse walls. Key constraints include a wall immediately left of start at (1,8) blocking direct left movement from row 1. A wall at (2,2) partially blocks row 2 on the left side. Other walls are isolated and do not block primary paths to the goal but could create minor detours if paths veer near them (e.g., row 4 col 8 or row 5 col 7). No full barriers divide the grid; multiple paths exist. Manhattan distance: 3 down + 8 left = 11 moves minimum. Bounds must be respected: cannot go above row 1, below row 8, left of col 1, or right of col 10.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: General direction is primarily left (net 8 columns) with some down (net 3 rows). A straight-line approach fails due to initial wall at (1,8). Optimal strategy: move down to an open row for unobstructed leftward travel, then adjust down to goal.\n\nMultiple possible paths: (1) Down to row 3 (fully open: ----------), left across to col 1, down to row 4 (11 moves, minimal). (2) Left in row 2 after initial down, but blocked at (2,2), requiring detour (e.g., down to row 3 around col 2, then back up: longer, 13+ moves). (3) Go right to col 10 then down and left: much longer (extra right-left loops). (4) Down to row 4 first via col 9, then left: row 4 has wall at col 8, so cannot left-straight from col 9 (blocked), needs detour up/down around (4,8), inefficient.\n\nBlocked paths: Direct left from start hits (1,8) wall. Full left in row 2 hits (2,2). Left in row 4 from right hits (4,8). Down-first to row 5+ then left works but overshoots goal row.\n\nDead ends/traps: Row 1 right edge (col 10) leads to no progress (must backtrack). Row 2 left beyond col 3 traps if not detouring (cannot pass (2,2) to col 1). Row 5 col 7 wall creates minor pocket if path goes there unnecessarily. Avoid by prioritizing open rows like row 3.\n\nApproaches that fail and why: Greedy left-first: immediate wall collision at (1,8). Row 2 highway: col 2 wall forces unplanned detour, risking inefficiency or loops. BFS/DFS mindset: Explore level-by-level mentally; prioritize low-cost open lanes. Generic strategy: Identify 'highways' (fully open rows/cols), compute net displacement, check straight paths for blocks, plan minimal detours. Extensible to other domains: Break into subgoals (e.g., 'reach open row'), evaluate path costs, prune dead ends early via obstacle scanning.\n\nChosen path: DD then 8L then D (uses row 3 highway, minimal 11 moves).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nStart: (1,9)\n- Move D: Navigate around initial row 1 wall by going down.

All other cells are empty ('-') or the goal ('G').\n\nKey patterns and constraints: The grid is mostly open, especially in the upper and right areas. Walls form minor blockages: a pair in row 4 (columns 4-5) that could affect upward or central paths but is irrelevant for downward travel from the start. Lower walls at (6,3) and (7,2) create a 'trap' in the lower-left quadrant, narrowing passage and potentially leading to dead ends if not navigated carefully. Overall, movement requires +3 rows down and +3 columns right net displacement. Bounds: rows 1-8, columns 1-9—no moves allowed outside. No diagonal moves; only orthogonal (U/D/L/R).\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Multiple paths exist to the goal, but some are shorter and safer. Primary viable paths: (1) Move right along row 5 to column 4, then straight down to row 8 (bypasses lower-left walls entirely). Length: 6 moves. (2) Move down the left edge to row 8 column 1, then right to column 4 (goes under the walls). Length: 6 moves. Longer detours possible (e.g., up then around row 4 walls, right across top, down), but unnecessary as goal is down-right.\n\nBlocked paths: Cannot pass through any #. The row 4 ## blocks direct up-right from start but irrelevant here. Lower-left walls block: cannot cross from column 2 to 4 in row 6 (due to 6,3 #) or row 7 (due to 7,2 #).\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid: Entering the lower-left (e.g., to row 6 column 2) is a trap—no right (6,3 #), no down (7,2 #), forces backtrack. Left edge (column 1) down to row 8 works but doesn't trap. Upper areas open but wasteful.\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily down (to row 8) and right (to column 4). Optimal: right-first along open row 5 (all empty), then down column 4 (rows 6-8 empty).\n\nApproaches that fail and why:\n- Straight down then right: From (5,1) D-D-D to (8,1), then R-R-R works (6 moves), but if deviate right early (e.g., D to 6,1; R to 6,2; then stuck—no R/D), hits dead end.\n- Left moves: Impossible from column 1 (out of bounds).\n- Upward exploration: Row 4 ## forces detour left/right, but adds moves unnecessarily (e.g., U-U to row 3, RRR, DDD wastes steps).\n- Trying to squeeze between lower walls: Impossible due to staggered # at (6,3) and (7,2).\n\nGeneric strategies (extensible): Visualize grid mentally or sketch; identify net displacement (here +3D +3R). Prioritize open corridors (row 5 rightward). Spot choke points/walls early—plan around (e.g., stay right of column 3 post-row 5). Test short paths first (Manhattan distance 6; check column 4 viability). Explore alternatives via mental BFS: enqueue neighbors, avoid revisiting. Avoid greedy (e.g., down-first traps); consider dead ends as backtracking signals.

Patterns: The grid is almost entirely open space with no obstacles between start and goal; the single wall is isolated at the bottom-right, far from the relevant area (top-middle). Direct vertical and horizontal access to goal is unimpeded. No loops, chokepoints, or multi-layered barriers.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist due to open grid: shortest are 2 moves (e.g., UL or LU to go up 1, left 1). Longer paths possible by detouring (e.g., right to col5, down to row12, left across bottom avoiding #, up to goal), but inefficient and unnecessary. Blocked paths: None directly to goal; the wall at (11,4) blocks only approaches needing exactly that cell (e.g., a path going down to row11 col4 then left/up). Dead ends/traps: Minimal; open grid means few true dead ends, but wall creates a minor trap—if path funnels to (11,4) from adjacent cells, must backtrack (e.g., from (11,3) R hits wall, from (11,5) L hits wall, from (10,4) D hits wall). General direction: Primarily up (decrease row by 1) and left (decrease column by 1); net displacement (-1 row, -1 column). Failing approaches: (1) Ignoring bounds—e.g., L from col1 or U from row1 leads out-of-bounds (invalid); (2) Detouring through wall—e.g., down to row11, R to col4 hits # (cannot pass); (3) Overcomplicating with loops (e.g., R R D D ... U U L L) works but longer, risks hitting wall if misnavigating bottom; (4) Downward bias fails as goal is above start, increasing distance. BFS/DFS mentally: Prioritize shortest paths; explore neighbors level-by-level confirms 2-step solutions. Avoid greedy pitfalls like always going up first if blocked (not applicable here).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: UL (up then left)—direct, shortest, avoids any potential bottom detours. Alternate LU equally valid.\n- Start: row 6, col 2.\n- Move U: To row 5, col 2 (cell '-', empty; navigates nothing, direct above start).\n- Move L: To row 5, col 1 (cell 'G', goal; shifts left along open row 5).\nThis hugs the minimal displacement without deviation.\n\n# Verification\n\nTrace full path for UL:\n1.

No large barriers or mazes. Walls create minor local obstacles: a split wall in row 3 (columns 3 and 6), a right-side block in row 8 (columns 5-6), and a single wall at bottom-left (row 11, column 1).

Direct upward move from start is blocked by wall at row 4, col 4. Lower rows (7-10) have clustered walls forming potential traps. Upper rows (1-3) have isolated walls that could block leftward progress if approached incorrectly. Patterns: Vertical walls in cols 1-2 lower grid suggest avoiding downward detours; open corridors in row 5 and row 4 cols 1-3 enable left-up maneuvers. Overall, minimal obstacles near start-goal, but thorough checking prevents overlooking bounds or walls.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nGeneral direction: Net movement of 1 row up (-1 row) and 3 columns left (-3 cols). Shortest path length ~4 moves. Multiple paths exist:\n- Primary: Left to col 3 (row 5), up to row 4 col 3, left twice to goal (LULL). Efficient, stays local.\n- Alternate 1: Left thrice to row 5 col 1, up to goal (LLLU). Viable but 1 move longer.\n- Alternate 2: Right to col 5 row 5, down to row 6 col 5, left/down loops to row 5 col 1, up (longer, e.g., R D L L L L U). Unnecessary detour.\n- Blocked paths: Up first (U) hits wall at row 4 col 4. Down first then up risks entering lower maze (rows 7-10), where row 9 walls (##-##) create dead ends—e.g., row 9 col 3 is open but surrounded by #, trapping if entered without exit plan.\n- Dead ends/traps to avoid: Row 3 col 1 (# blocks left-up from below); row 8 col 3 (# splits row 8); row 9's clustered # force backtracking if overcommitted downward. Going right/down leads to longer paths with higher trap risk.\n- Failed approaches: Greedy 'always left then up' works here but fails in mazes with U-shaped blocks (e.g., if row 4 col 2 were #, need detour). BFS-like exploration (mentally enumerate neighbors, avoid revisits) ensures optimality. Backtracking from dead ends teaches: Simulate 1-2 moves ahead, prioritize goal direction, deprioritize opposites (down/right here). Extensible: In other domains (e.g., chess, scheduling), prioritize high-reward directions, prune low-promise branches early.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nStart: row 5, col 4.\n- Move L: To row 5, col 3 (empty -). Navigates around implicit right-wall pressure, opens up-path.\n- Move U: To row 4, col 3 (empty -). Bypasses wall at row 4 col 4.\n- Move L: To row 4, col 2 (empty -). Direct toward goal column.\n- Move L: To row 4, col 1 (G). Reaches goal.\n\nThis avoids all walls, uses minimal moves.

Player starts at row 4, column 4 (@). Goal at row 6, column 1 (G). Wall locations (#): row 1 col 6; row 2 col 1; row 5 col 5; row 7 col 3; row 8 col 7; row 9 col 6. Patterns/constraints: Walls are sparse and scattered, creating open spaces on the left and right sides, but specific blocks like row 2 col 1 prevent upper-left access, row 5 col 5 blocks mid-down-right from start, row 7 col 3 creates a minor protrusion on lower-left, and lower walls (row 8 col 7, row 9 col 6) could affect long detours. Left side (cols 1-4) is mostly open from rows 3-6 except noted walls. Manhattan distance: 2 down + 3 left = 5 moves minimum. Must stay within bounds (rows 1-9, cols 1-12) and avoid all #.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple possible paths exist due to open space: e.g., go fully left then down (LLLDD), fully down then left (DDLLL), or interleaved (e.g., LDLDLD, longer). Shortest paths are 5 moves, any permutation of 3L + 2D avoiding walls/bounds. Blocked paths: Cannot go left-up to row 2 col 1 (# blocks); cannot cross row 5 col 5 (#) if moving down-right from start; row 7 col 3 blocks some lower-left zigzags if over-right. Dead ends/traps: Going far right (e.g., RRRRR to col 9+) leads to open space but requires backtracking (wasted moves); hugging bottom-right hits row 8 col 7 or row 9 col 6, forcing detour; attempting left from col 1 hits bounds (invalid L). General direction: Primarily left 3, down 2—stay in left half (cols 1-5) to avoid unnecessary detours. Approaches that fail: (1) Upward exploration (U then L) hits row 2 col 1 # or row 1 col 6 #, dead end requiring backtrack; (2) Down-right (DRDR) hits row 5 col 5 #, blocks progress; (3) Over-down (e.g., DDD to row 7 col 4) then left navigates row 7 col 3 # but possible, longer and risks row 8/9 walls; (4) Bound violations like L from col 1. BFS/DFS mentally: Prioritize left/down, avoid right/up. Extensible strategy: Compute Manhattan, identify wall 'chokepoints', test direct paths first, simulate alternates for blocks, avoid backtrack by bounding search (e.g., no >5 moves initially).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: LLLDD (direct left then down; minimal, avoids all walls/dead ends). Start: (4,4). Move L: to (4,3) [empty, navigates open row 4 left corridor]. Move L: to (4,2) [empty]. Move L: to (4,1) [empty, reaches left bound safely]. Move D: to (5,1) [empty, avoids row 5 col 5 # by staying left]. Move D: to (6,1) [G, success]. This skirts left wall, ignores right open space and lower walls.\n\nAlternate explored: DDLLL—(4,4) D (5,4 empty, skirts row 5 col 5), D (6,4 empty), L (6,3), L (6,2), L (6,1). Also works, equivalent length. LDLDL longer (6 moves). Avoided: R-any (leads to detour); U (hits upper walls).\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace: Start (4,4). 1: L → (4,3) [- no #, bounds ok]. 2: L → (4,2) [- no #]. 3: L → (4,1) [- no #]. 4: D → (5,1) [- row5 col1 empty, != col5 #]. 5: D → (6,1) [G]. Total 5 moves. No walls hit (checked each cell: row4 cols4-1 all -, row5 col1 -, row6 col1 G). All in bounds (cols 1-4, rows 4-6). Ends exactly at goal. No errors; alternates like DDLLL: (4,4)D(5,4)-D(6,4)-L(6,3)-L(6,2)-L(6,1) also verifies clean. Wrong path test: e.g., ULLL from start: U(3,4)-L(3,3)-L(3,2)-L(3,1) ok but then U(2,1)=#, invalid—confirms up-left trap.\n\n# Solution\n\nLLLDD</think>\n\n{\"solution\": \"LLLDD\"}"}],"llmPathLength":5}

Key constraints include impassable walls (#), staying within bounds (rows 1-8, columns 1-10), and orthogonal moves only (no diagonals). The walls create localized blockages: (4,1) obstructs upward travel in column 1 at row 4; (3,3) blocks column 3 at row 3; (6,8) is a minor obstacle in the bottom-right. No other patterns like mazes or clusters; mostly free navigation. Manhattan distance: |8-2| + |4-2| = 6 up + 2 left = 8 moves minimum.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Primary directions are UP (net 6 steps to reduce row) and LEFT (net 2 steps to reduce column). Multiple viable paths exist due to openness, but order matters to avoid walls.\n\n- Possible paths: (1) Move left to column 2 first (open corridor), then up fully (column 2 clear from row 8 to 2). (2) Move up fully in safe column 4 (fully open), then left at row 2. (3) Mixed paths like up some, left, up more.\n- Blocked paths: Column 1 upward hits wall at (4,1) -- cannot pass from row 5 col 1 up. Column 3 upward blocked at (3,3) -- cannot enter from row 4 col 3 up.\n- Dead ends/traps to avoid: Entering column 1 below row 4 and trying to go up leads to blockage; must detour right to column 2. Overcommitting to column 3 near row 4 traps you below the (3,3) wall, requiring backtrack. Far right paths around (6,8) are longer and unnecessary.\n- General direction: Mostly up, slightly left. Prioritize safe vertical corridors (columns 2, 4+ are reliable through critical rows 3-4).\n- Failed approaches:\n  - All left to col 1 then up: Hits (4,1)# after 4 ups from row 8, dead end.\n  - Left to col 3 then up: Hits (3,3)# after 5 ups, dead end.\n  - Ignoring bounds: e.g., left from col 1 or up from row 1 invalid.\n\nGeneric strategies (extensible): Compute Manhattan distance for baseline. Identify safe lanes (columns/rows without walls). Mentally simulate paths, prioritizing minimal detours. Explore risky alternatives to map dead ends (e.g., test col 1/3). Use divide-and-conquer: handle horizontal then vertical if one axis safer. Verify by reverse-tracing from goal.

The walls are in the lower half: one blocking the bottom-left corner entrance (row 5 col 1), and two in column 7 at rows 6 and 8, creating a partial barrier in column 7 for bottom-up travel. No walls obstruct the upper rows (1-4) or most columns. Player must move up 1 row net and right 4 columns net (Manhattan distance 5). Moves must stay within bounds (rows 1-9, cols 1-8) and avoid # cells. G is passable as the destination.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist due to open space: primary options are combinations of 1 U and 4 R in any order (e.g., U then RRRR, RRRR then U, or interleaved like RRURR). All shortest paths (5 moves) stay in rows 2-3, columns 3-7, fully open.\n\nBlocked paths: No direct blocks to goal, but walls create dead ends elsewhere. E.g., entering lower grid (rows 5+) via column 1 is possible but row 5 col 1 blocks leftmost path; more critically, column 7 walls at row 6 and 8 trap anyone trying bottom-up ascent in col 7 (can't pass # upward). Going left/down first leads to mazes around walls but longer detours (e.g., to reach goal from bottom requires looping around col 7 walls, adding 10+ moves).\n\nDead ends/traps: Lower column 7 is segmented by # at row 6 col 7 and row 8 col 7—entering row 7-9 col 7 allows no escape upward. Row 5 col 1 creates minor left dead end if hugging walls. Avoid descending unnecessarily.\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily right (net +4 cols) and slightly up (net -1 row). Stay upper-mid grid.\n\nFailed approaches: 1) Pure down then up: Hits col 7 walls, can't reach row 2 col 7 without backtracking far right/left (e.g., go row 9 col 8, up avoiding col 7, but 15+ moves). 2) Leftward exploration: Reaches col 1 rows 1-4 open, but row 5 col 1 blocks, forces detour; no goal progress. 3) Over-right to col 8 then left: Works but longer (extra moves). 4) Ignoring bounds: E.g., RRRRR from start goes to col 8 row 3 (ok), but RRRRRR out of bounds (invalid). Shortest paths avoid these by prioritizing right/up only.\n\nGeneric strategies: Visualize grid mentally/trace paths; compute Manhattan distance for baseline; identify obstacles & bypass routes; prioritize low-risk areas (open upper grid); test short paths first; use 'flood fill' mental BFS to spot dead ends; extensible to mazes via A* heuristics or wall skirting.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: RRRRU (right-focused first to align column, then up; avoids any hypothetical row 2 edge issues, though none exist).\n- Start: row 3, col 3\n- R: to row 3, col 4 (empty -)\n- R: to row 3, col 5 (empty -)\n- R: to row 3, col 6 (empty -)\n- R: to row 3, col 7 (empty -; navigates open row 3 corridor)\n- U: to row 2, col 7 (G; reaches goal, no obstacle)\n\nAlternate explored: URRRR also works identically (up first to row 2 col 3 empty, then rights along open row 2).

Bottom row 5 at column 3 rightward blocked by (5,4), creating a dead end if navigated there carelessly (e.g., D D R from start). Leftward exploration leads nowhere near goal.\n- Viable strategies: (1) Upper detour: Go up early to row 2, right to (2,6), up to row 1 (open at col6-8), right across (1,7)-(1,8), down to goal. Bypasses (2,7) by going over. (2) Lower detour: Down to row 4 (fully open), right to column 8, up twice to goal. Avoids all upper walls.\n- Why certain approaches fail: Greedy right/up fails due to (3,4). Pure row 2 traversal fails at (2,7). Bottom blind navigation risks (5,4). No diagonal moves, so must respect grid.\n\nGeneric strategies (extensible to other domains): Visualize grid mentally or sketch; identify local obstacles and plan immediate detours (e.g., up instead of right). Consider adjacent rows/columns for bypass routes (layered navigation). Systematically evaluate first moves (U/D/L/R from start: R invalid, L unproductive, U/D promising). Mentally simulate BFS-like exploration from goal backward or forward, pruning dead ends (e.g., areas left of col3 unreachable to goal efficiently). Prioritize paths minimizing backtrack by checking chokepoints (e.g., crossing col7). In broader pathfinding/AI planning: use obstacle-relative heuristics, explore multi-hop detours, verify bounds/invariants.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Upper detour via row 1 (efficient bypass of (2,7), explores open upper space).\n- Start: (3,3)\n- U to (2,3): Navigates around (3,4) by going up first; (2,3) open.\n- R to (2,4): Clear path on row 2.\n- R to (2,5): Continuing right, avoiding row 1 walls ahead.\n- R to (2,6): Now at chokepoint before (2,7).\n- U to (1,6): Detour up; (1,6) open, bypasses (2,7).\n- R to (1,7): Row 1 open here.\n- R to (1,8): Positions above goal.\n- D to (2,8): Drop down to goal.\nObstacles navigated: (3,4) via initial U; (2,7) via U-R-R-D loop on upper layer.\n\n# Verification\n\nTrace entire solution URRRURRD:\n- Start: (3,3)\n- 1.

Wall locations (#) are:\n- Row 3, column 3\n- Row 6, column 1\n- Row 7, column 5\n- Row 8, column 5\n- Row 9, column 2\n\nPatterns and constraints: The grid is mostly open empty cells (-), with sparse walls concentrated in the lower-left and lower-center areas, plus one wall near the goal in the upper-middle. Net displacement needed: up 3 rows (decrease row by 3), left 2 columns (decrease column by 2). Moves must stay within bounds (rows 1-9, columns 1-9) and avoid walls. No diagonal moves; only U (up: row-1), D (down: row+1), L (left: col-1), R (right: col+1). Generic strategy: Compute Manhattan distance (here 5) as lower bound; identify local obstacles; visualize or mentally BFS to find viable paths.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist due to open space (e.g., direct up-then-left, left-then-up, or zigzags totaling 5+ moves). General direction: primarily up and slightly left. Blocked paths: Cannot pass row 3 col 3 # (blocks early left moves at row 3); row 6 col 1 # traps extreme left at start; row 7/8 col 5 ## double wall blocks center-down traversal; row 9 col 2 # limits bottom-left navigation.\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid:\n- Going left from start to row 6 col 1 (#).\n- Venturing down (e.g., D from start to (7,7)), then left into row 7/8 col 5 ##, creating a cul-de-sac requiring backtrack (e.g., from (7,5) impossible, must detour right/up, adding 10+ moves).\n- Bottom row 9: col 2 # forces rightward detour to escape left side.\n- Early left at row 3 hits col 3 # (e.g., from (3,4) L to (3,3) blocked).\n\nApproaches that fail and why:\n- Pure left then up (LLLL...): Hits row 6 col 1 # after 6L.\n- Down-first: Traps in lower maze-like walls, inefficient (longer path ~15 moves vs. 5).\n- Right/up mix: Works but longer (e.g., RRRUUU LLL ~9 moves).\n- Ignoring bounds: U from row 1 or L from col 1 out-of-bounds (invalid).\n\nBest strategy: Prioritize net direction (up 3, left 2) via shortest open path (UUULL or LLUUU). Generic extensible reasoning: 1) Net vector analysis for direction. 2) Scan for proximal obstacles. 3) Evaluate local moves, prune dead ends via mental simulation. 4) Prefer minimal moves (Manhattan if clear). 5) In complex grids, BFS/DFS with backtracking; here, visual inspection suffices. Transferable: Applies to mazes, games (e.g., chess king moves), robotics pathfinding.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: UUULL (direct up to row 3, then left to goal; minimal 5 moves, avoids all walls).\n- Start: (6,7)\n- U: to (5,7) [row 5 all empty, no obstacle]\n- U: to (4,7) [row 4 all empty]\n- U: to (3,7) [row 3 col 7 empty (-), navigates around distant row 3 col 3 #]\n- L: to (3,6) [row 3 col 6 empty (-)]\n- L: to (3,5) [goal G, success]\n\nAlternate explored: LLUUU\n- Start (6,7) L (6,6) empty, L (6,5) empty [navigates around row 6 col 1 #], U (5,5), U (4,5), U (3,5) G [straight up col 5, avoids row 3 col 3 # by arriving at col 5].

Blocked paths: Cannot pass row 5 col 4 # (blocks direct down from row 4 col 4); row 4 col 1 # blocks left side of row 4; leftward moves lead to wall clusters (row 6 col 1, row 7 col 2). Dead ends/traps: Venturing left/down into row 6+ col 1-2 hits walls; bottom-right (row 7 col 8-9 ##, row 9 col 8 #) is impassable cul-de-sac—going too far down/right traps player needing backtrack. Upward (rows 1-2) is open but detour, lengthens path unnecessarily. Failing approaches: Greedy down-first then right works but hits potential block if shifted left; left/up then loop-around fails efficiently due to left walls forcing long detours (e.g., row 3 col 1 left-open but row 4 col 1 # requires up/down绕行); BFS/A* generic strategy: treat grid as graph, prioritize low manhattan heuristic (dist to goal: |Δrow| + |Δcol|), expand neighbors avoiding #/bounds—reveals shortest paths quickly.

Player starts at row 10, column 4 (@). Goal at row 6, column 2 (G). Wall locations: row 2 column 9 (#), row 4 column 4 (#). The grid is mostly empty ('-'), with only two isolated walls. Patterns: open space allows many paths; walls are minor—one far top-right irrelevant to direct path, one at row 4 col 4 above goal but not blocking access to row 6 col 2. Constraints: cannot pass # walls; must stay within row 1-12, col 1-9; moves only U/D/L/R (up decreases row, down increases row).\n\nManhattan distance: 4 up + 2 left = 6 moves minimum. No tight corridors or mazes, but bounds and walls require caution.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Need to move generally up (net 4 rows) and left (net 2 columns). Multiple paths exist due to open grid (e.g., left first then up, or up first then left, or zigzag). Shortest paths are 6 moves.\n\nBlocked paths: Direct path unaffected by walls. Wall at row 4 col 4 blocks if path goes exactly there (e.g., up-up-up-up from start hits row 6 col 4 empty, but further up would hit it—irrelevant). Wall at row 2 col 9 blocks top-right corner.\n\nDead ends/traps: Going down (to row 11/12) increases distance, no walls but leads to bottom dead end (must backtrack). Going right to col 9 then up risks row 2 col 9 wall, creating minor detour. Left to col 1 open but unnecessary extra moves. No true traps, but inefficient detours (e.g., right 5 then left 7) waste moves.\n\nGeneral direction: Prioritize up and left; interleave to stay safe.\n\nFailed approaches: (1) Ignoring bounds—e.g., left 4 from col 4 hits col 0 invalid. (2) Through walls—e.g., up 6 to row 4 col 4 then right fails (impassable). (3) Down first—e.g., DDD then up 7 left 2 = 12 moves, inefficient. (4) Right detour—R to col 9, up hits row 2 #, must L then up, longer. BFS or A* mentally favors direct paths; greedy up/left works here.\n\nExtensible strategies: Compute Manhattan heuristic for direction; visualize grid mentally or sketch; explore branches depth-first but prune dead ends (increasing distance); confirm no obstacles in candidate paths; verify bounds/walls before committing.\n\nChosen strategy: Left 2 first (align column), then up 4. Simple, direct, avoids any potential right-bound issues.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nStart: row 10, col 4.\n- Move L: to row 10, col 3 (empty '-').\n- Move L: to row 10, col 2 (empty '-').\n- Move U: to row 9, col 2 (empty '-').

Player starts at row 1, column 3 (@). Goal is at row 4, column 1 (G). There are no walls (#) anywhere on the grid—all cells are empty (-), making the entire grid fully traversable. Key constraints: must stay within bounds (rows 1-7, columns 1-9); cannot pass through walls (none present). Patterns: completely open space, no obstacles, so pathfinding is straightforward. Manhattan distance is |4-1| + |1-3| = 3 down + 2 left = 5 moves minimum. No patterns like mazes or chokepoints.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Multiple possible paths exist (any sequence netting +3 rows down and -2 columns left, without going out of bounds). For example, all downs then lefts (DDDLL), all lefts then downs (LLDDD), or interleaved (e.g., DLDLD). No paths are blocked since no walls. No dead ends or traps—bounds are the only limits (cannot go above row 1, below row 7, left of col 1, or right of col 9). General direction needed: primarily down (net +3 rows) and left (net -2 columns). Shortest paths are 5 moves; longer paths are possible but inefficient.\n\nApproaches that would NOT work and why:\n- Going up (U) from start: hits row 0 bound (invalid).\n- Going left from column 1: hits col 0 bound (e.g., after one L at r1c1, another L fails).\n- Excessive right (R) or down (D): lengthens path unnecessarily and risks row 7/col 9 bounds if overdone (e.g., RRRRRRRR hits col 9+), but not fatal here.\n- Random zigzagging: works but inefficient; teaches avoiding by prioritizing net displacement.\nGeneric strategies: Compute net displacement (delta_row = +3, delta_col = -2). Use BFS mentally for shortest path in grids with obstacles (here unnecessary due to openness). Prioritize moves toward goal (down/left). Explore alternates: LLDDD hugs left edge safely; DDDLL stays central. Dead ends only at bounds—avoid by checking position pre-move. Extensible: In walled grids, mark visited to prevent loops; here, none needed. Backtrack mentally if bound hit.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: LLDDD (lefts first to reach col 1 early, then downs—avoids any potential left-bound issues mid-path).\n- Current position: row 1, col 3.

Player starts at (2,3). Goal at (3,0). Wall locations: (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0). All other cells are passable empty spaces (-), including the goal (G).\n\nKey constraints: Moves must stay within bounds (rows 0-4, cols 0-3). Cannot pass through walls (#). No diagonal moves; only U (row-1), D (row+1), L (col-1), R (col+1). Patterns: Open corridor along row 2 (cols 0-3 all empty). Dense wall cluster at row 3 cols 1-2 and row 4 col 0 blocks direct leftward or bottom-up access to goal. Goal (3,0) has limited access: neighbors are up (2,0 open), down (4,0 wall), left (out of bounds), right (3,1 wall). Thus, the only entry to goal is from (2,0).\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nGeneral direction: Left 3 columns and down 1 row overall. Multiple paths exist but many lead to dead ends. Optimal strategy: Exploit the fully open row 2 corridor to reach (2,0), then drop down to goal. This is shortest (4 moves) and avoids traps.\n\nBlocked paths:\n- Direct down then left from start: D to (3,3 open), but L hits (3,2 #). Stuck horizontally on row 3 right side.\n- Bottom detour: From (3,3) D to (4,3 open), L to (4,2/4,1 open), but U from (4,1) hits (3,1 #), U from (4,2) hits (3,2 #), L from (4,1) hits (4,0 #). No path to (3,0) from row 4; it's isolated by walls.\n- Upward exploration: U to (1,3 open), but L hits (1,2 #), limiting left progress. Further U to (0,3 open), L hits (0,2 #). Dead end for efficient goal access; requires backtracking south.\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid: Row 4 left side (trapped by # at 4,0 and 3,1/3,2). Row 1/0 right side (walled leftward). Failing to prioritize row 2 leftward travel misses the sole goal entry point.\n\nWhy certain approaches fail:\n- Greedy 'down first' ignores wall analysis; doesn't check goal connectivity.\n- No systematic search (e.g., mental BFS): Start explores neighbors, but without tracing access to goal, hits local blocks.\n- Generic strategies for transfer: 1) Map all positions/walls explicitly. 2) Identify goal neighbors for chokepoints. 3) Visualize/test paths mentally, prioritizing open corridors. 4) Consider bounds/walls as hard constraints; explore alternates via 'what if' branching. 5) BFS-like: Level-by-level distance from start, pruning invalid. This extensible to mazes, graphs: reduces recomputation, spots cycles/dead ends early.\n\nChosen path: LLLD along row 2, then D. No revisits needed; minimal.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nStart: (2,3)\n- Move L: To (2,2). Navigates open cell; stays in row 2 corridor, avoids upper walls.\n- Move L: To (2,1).

Several walls in column 5 (rows 3 and 6) block upward movement from the start. Walls near the goal in row 9 column 4 and row 10 column 3 create local obstacles, potentially trapping careless leftward detours. Notably, the direct vertical path in column 5 from row 7 to row 9 has no walls: row 8 column 5 is empty (-), row 9 column 5 is the goal (G, passable). This suggests a simple downward path is viable, but thorough analysis requires checking alternatives and risks.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Start and goal share the same column (5), only 2 rows apart, so primary direction is down (D).

(2) List all walls relative to start/goal. (3) Mentally simulate bounds/obstacles. (4) Identify chokepoints (narrow columns). (5) Explore alternates briefly to confirm no traps. (6) Prefer vertical/horizontal straights in grids.

Only one impassable wall in the bottom row, far to the right. Column 1 is completely open from row 1 to row 9 (except player start and goal). No other obstacles. Moves must stay within bounds (rows 1-9, cols 1-10); cannot pass through #. Paths can move freely except avoiding the single # and bounds.\n\nGeneric strategy note: In open grids with few obstacles, prioritize shortest paths by aligning with net displacement (here, +6 rows down, 0 columns). Always map positions explicitly to avoid off-by-one errors. Visualize or mentally grid-search for blocks.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple possible paths: Yes, infinitely many due to open space (e.g., go right to col 10, down, left back). Shortest paths are 6 moves (minimum Manhattan distance: |8-2| + |1-1| = 6 downs). Any detour adds moves.\n\nBlocked paths: Only paths trying to occupy row 8, col 6 exactly are invalid, but since goal is col 1, most paths avoid it naturally. No full blockages.\n\nDead ends or traps: None. No enclosed areas or loops leading to blocks. Bottom row has # but open around it (can go left/right past it). Going up from row 2 hits row 1 bound quickly; left from col 1 hits col 0 bound.\n\nGeneral direction needed: Primarily down (net 6 downs). Stay near column 1 to minimize later adjustments. Rightward exploration possible but inefficient.\n\nApproaches that would fail:\n- Going left/up immediately: Hits left bound (col 0 invalid) or top bound (row 0 invalid), no progress to goal.\n- Going all-right then down: Valid but longer (e.g., 9R +6D +9L = 24 moves vs 6).\n- Down to row 8 early in wrong column, then left/right into #: E.g., go to row 8 col 6 directly (DDDDDRRRR) hits # on last R. But avoidable by not targeting col 6.\n- Ignoring bounds: E.g., 10L from start goes out of bounds.\n\nGeneric strategy: Compute Manhattan distance for baseline. BFS mentally for shortest path in sparse obstacles (explore level-by-level: all 1-move, 2-move positions). Prioritize direct axis-aligned moves. Flag potential traps by checking if obstacles create 'U-turns' (none here). Test detours: simulate 1-step deviation (e.g., R then compensate L later) to confirm viability but note length increase.\n\nChosen strategy: Direct downs along col 1 (optimal, zero risk).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Straight down column 1.\n\n1.

Player starts at row 2, column 4 (@). Goal at row 5, column 5 (G). Wall locations: (1,4), (3,3), (4,2), (4,4), (5,3). All other cells are empty (-).\n\nPatterns and constraints: Walls form partial barriers in the center and lower middle, blocking direct leftward movement from start and some downward paths. The grid is mostly open on the right and bottom, suggesting paths favoring right and down. Manhattan distance is 3 down + 1 right = 4 moves minimum. Key constraint: no diagonal moves; must stay in bounds (rows/cols 1-6); cannot pass walls. This setup encourages rightward detour to avoid central walls before descending.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple possible paths exist, such as right-then-down (RDDD) or down-then-right-then-down (DRDD), both 4 moves. Paths blocked: direct down-down hits wall at (4,4) after (2,4) -> D (3,4) -> D (4,4)#. Left from start blocked by (2,3)# (row 2: columns 1-2 open, col3 #). Up blocked by (1,4)#.\n\nDead ends/traps: Going left impossible immediately. From (3,4), down leads to (4,4)# dead end; must right to (3,5) first. Lower left area (e.g., row 4 col1-3) has walls at (4,2)# and (5,3)#, creating a cul-de-sac if over-committing left/down without right progress. Bottom row (6) is fully open but detour unnecessary.\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily down (net +3 rows), slight right (+1 col). Generic strategy: Prioritize BFS-like exploration (shortest path mindset: explore minimal moves level-by-level mentally). Avoid greedy dead ends (e.g., don't tunnel straight down without checking ahead). Identify 'chokepoints' (e.g., walls force right before final descent). Test alternates: RDDD avoids all walls directly; DRDD navigates around (4,4)# by shifting right mid-path. Failed approaches: Left-heavy (blocked at start); up-then-around (unnecessary, hits top wall); bottom-loop (row6 then up, inefficient >4 moves). Extensible: In other domains (e.g., mazes, routing), map obstacles, compute min distance, prune blocked branches early, prefer open corridors.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: RDDD (direct, efficient; avoids traps by prioritizing right to open column 5 descent).\n- Current: (2,4). Direction: R. New: (2,5). Navigated: Avoided left wall at (2,3)#; right opens clear down path.\n- Current: (2,5). Direction: D. New: (3,5).

Navigated: Final drop past (5,3)# to the left.\n\nAlternate DRDD also works but chosen for simplicity (single column shift). Explored: DRDD - (2,4)D(3,4) [avoids (3,3)# left], R(3,5), D(4,5), D(5,5).

Player starts at (8,1). Goal is at (7,2). Walls (#) are impassable and located at:\n- Row 1: columns 1, 7\n- Row 2: column 1\n- Row 3: columns 2, 4\n- Row 4: column 5\n- Row 5: column 1\n\nAll other cells are empty (-) or the goal (G), which is passable. Key constraints: stay within bounds (rows 1-10, cols 1-8); cannot pass through walls. Patterns: walls cluster in the upper-left (rows 1-5, cols 1-2 and scattered), creating potential barriers if navigating high up, but the goal is low (row 7), so lower rows are mostly open. No walls directly block the shortest paths from start to goal. The minimal displacement is up 1 row and right 1 column.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist due to open lower grid. Shortest paths are 2 moves: 'UR' (up to (7,1), right to (7,2)) or 'RU' (right to (8,2), up to (7,2))—both direct and unblocked. Row 7 and 8 are fully open except goal placement.\n\nBlocked paths: Cannot go left from col 1 (out of bounds). Down from row 8 leads to rows 9-10 (open but away from goal, inefficient). Paths going far right (e.g., to col 8) then up and left work but are longer (e.g., RRRRRRURRLLLLLL ~15 moves) and unnecessary.\n\nDead ends/traps: Upper-left maze-like area—e.g., from lower grid, going up-left hits row 5 col 1 #, row 3 col 2 #, row 2 col 1 #, row 1 col 1 #; row 3 col 4 # blocks some crossings. Trying to loop around via row 4 col 5 # could trap if zigzagging unnecessarily. No true dead ends from start (grid connected), but upper walls force detours if over-navigating north.\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily up (decrease row by 1) and right (increase col by 1); prioritize minimal moves to avoid walls. BFS/DFS mentally: explore neighbors level-by-level; level 1: (7,1),(8,2),(9,1); level 2 reaches goal via (7,1)->(7,2) or (8,2)->(7,2).\n\nFailed approaches: Greedy always-up fails if higher walls but not here; always-right then up works but suboptimal. Ignoring bounds (e.g., L from col 1 crashes). Over-exploring up to row 6 col 1 (open), then right, loops back longer. Random walks risk inefficiency but grid openness allows recovery.\n\nOptimal strategy: Shortest path via Manhattan distance (2), check direct neighbors first—viable here. Extensible: In mazes, prioritize low-cost directions toward goal; prune blocked/explored; detect cycles/dead ends by backtracking.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: 'UR' (shortest, direct; 'RU' equivalent).\n- Current: (8,1). Move U (up). New: (7,1) [row 7 col 1 is '-'; no obstacle, direct above start, open].\n- Current: (7,1). Move R (right).

Player starts at row 1, column 3 (@). Goal is at row 4, column 4 (G). There are no walls (#) anywhere in the grid—all cells are empty (-), making it a completely open space. Key constraints: moves must stay within bounds (rows 1-12, columns 1-5); cannot go out of bounds. No impassable obstacles, but bounds act as implicit barriers. Patterns: fully traversable grid with no blockages; shortest path determined by Manhattan distance: |4-1| row difference (3 down) + |4-3| column difference (1 right) = 4 minimum moves. General constraint: any path must net +3 rows down and +1 column right, without exiting bounds.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Multiple possible paths exist due to open grid—any sequence netting 3D and 1R works, but shortest paths (4 moves) are optimal. No blocked paths since no walls. Potential dead ends or traps: none from walls, but bounds create risks—e.g., moving U from row 1 goes out of bounds (invalid); L from col 1 or R from col 5 invalid; excessive D to row 12 then needing to U back is inefficient but not trapping. General direction needed: primarily down (to increase row from 1 to 4) with one right shift (col 3 to 4). \n\nApproaches that would NOT work and why:\n- Going up (U): immediately out of bounds from row 1; no benefit as goal is below.\n- Going left (L) multiple times: hits col 1 bound quickly, requires compensating R later (wasteful detours, longer path).\n- Going right (R) multiple times: hits col 5 bound, same issue.\n- Going down excessively (e.g., to row 12): reaches bottom bound, then must U back up (very long, 3D +1R + extra Ds and Us, e.g., 20+ moves unnecessary).\n- Zigzagging (L then R, U then D): increases length without progress.\n\nBest strategy: shortest path via direct net movement (3D +1R in any order), staying central to avoid bounds. Mentally simulate BFS layers: layer 1 (3 moves): positions reachable in 3 moves; check if goal adjacent. Prioritize down-right. Alternate paths: e.g., RDDD (right first, then down); DDRD (down, down, right, down); DRDD. All 4-move paths equivalent in open grid. Avoid longer paths to teach efficiency. Generic strategy extensible: compute Manhattan distance for lower bound; check for obstacles (none here); enumerate short paths or use greedy (move toward goal delta); verify bounds; backtrack if dead-end (not needed). In other domains (e.g., with walls), use A* heuristic or wall-avoidance.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: DDDR (direct down to row 4, then right; keeps column central early, avoids any hypothetical edge risks).\n- Start: row 1, col 3.\n  Move D → new position: row 2, col 3 (empty, progress toward goal row).\n- Current: row 2, col 3.\n  Move D → new position: row 3, col 3 (empty, continuing down).\n- Current: row 3, col 3.\n  Move D → new position: row 4, col 3 (empty, now at goal row, slight left of goal col; navigated around no obstacles, just bounds implicitly).\n- Current: row 4, col 3.\n  Move R → new position: row 4, col 4 (G, success).\n\nAlternate explored: RDDD—start R to (1,4), D(2,4), D(3,4), D(4,4). Equally valid, but DDDR chosen for column stability. Longer alternate (e.g., DLDRR): D(2,3), L(2,2), D(3,2), R(3,3), R(3,4), D(4,4)—6 moves, wasteful left detour to dead-end-ish bound proximity.\n\n# Verification\n\nTrace entire solution DDDR move-by-move:\n1.

Player starts at (row 8, col 3). Goal at (row 3, col 3). Wall locations: (1,4), (3,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (8,1), (8,4).\n\nKey patterns/constraints: Narrow 4-column grid limits maneuvering. Primary blockage is row 5 cols 3-4 (##), preventing straight ascent in col 3 from below. Row 3 col 2 (#) blocks left-side access to goal at row 3 col 3. Col 4 has multiple walls (rows 1,5,6,8), making right-side navigation risky or impossible. Col 1 has wall only at row 8. Open paths exist mainly in cols 1-2 for bypassing row 5 blockage. Overall, must move primarily up (5 net ups needed), but requires left detour around row 5 cols 3-4. Bounds: rows 1-8, cols 1-4—no moves out of bounds.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple possible paths exist, but all require left detour around row 5 col 3 # (core obstacle). Optimal paths go up col 3 to row 6 col 3, left to col 2, up through row 5 col 2, then right and up to goal. Alternatives: detour left earlier (e.g., row 8 col 2) or use col 1, but these are longer (e.g., LUUUURU = 7 moves vs. 7 in main path, but unnecessary detours). Paths blocked: straight up col 3 hits row 5 col 3 # (dead end at row 6 col 3 if no left). Rightward paths fail—row 8 col 4 # blocks initial R; row 6 col 4 # blocks later R from row 6 col 3; row 5 col 4 # compounds. Dead ends/traps: lingering in col 4 leads to walls (rows 1,5,6); approaching goal from row 3 col 2 # impossible. Upper row 1 col 4 # irrelevant unless overshooting.\n\nApproaches that fail: (1) Straight UUUUU—hits row 5 col 3 #, no way around without backtracking. (2) Right-heavy (R attempts)—immediate walls or no connection to goal. (3) Down (D)—out of bounds, wastes moves. (4) Early left to col 1 without need—works but inefficient, risks row 8 col 1 # if L too far initially. (5) Late right from col 2—row 5 col 3 # blocks.\n\nGeneral direction: Up-dominant (exactly 5 U to reach row 3), left detour (L once), right correction (R once). Generic strategies: Visualize grid mentally/draw; identify chokepoints (row 5 ##); plan detours around obstacles; prioritize main direction (up) while scouting branches; mentally simulate short paths first (BFS-like: explore level-by-level from start); check dead ends by tracing to walls/bounds; backtrack virtually (e.g., 'if up blocked, try L then U'); extensible to other domains like maze-solving (obstacle avoidance), routing (traffic blocks), or planning (resource constraints)—emphasizes systematic enumeration over trial-error.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Delay left detour until row 6 col 3 (maximizes col 3 progress before bypass). UU to row 6 col 3 (open vertical). L navigates around row 5 col 3 # via col 2. UU advances past blockage. R repositions to col 3 under goal (row 3 col 2 # avoided).

Key constraints: must stay within bounds (rows 1-7, columns 1-6); cannot pass through walls (none exist). Patterns: unobstructed straight-line movement possible in all directions. Manhattan distance: 5 rows down (row 2 to 7) + 2 columns right (col 4 to 6) = 7 moves minimum. General constraint: moves must not exit grid bounds (e.g., no U from row 1, no L from col 1, no D from row 7, no R from col 6).\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist due to open grid—any sequence of exactly 5 D and 2 R reaches the goal in 7 moves (shortest path), while detours (extra U/L then compensating) work but are longer. No blocked paths or walls, so no impassable routes. Potential dead ends or traps: none, as grid is fully traversable; however, going excessively U (to row 1) or L (to col 1) creates 'soft dead ends' requiring backtracking (e.g., U then must D later), increasing move count unnecessarily. General direction: primarily down (net +5 rows) and right (net +2 columns); avoid net up or left to minimize moves. Approaches that fail: sequences going out of bounds (e.g., LLL from start hits col1 then invalid L); staying at top/left too long wastes moves without progress; pure left/up paths never reach goal without compensation. Optimal strategy: prioritize down and right in any order (commutative in open grid), e.g., all rights first then downs, or interleave. BFS/DFS mentally: explore neighbors, but here trivial.

General direction: primarily down (4 net steps), slight right (1 net). \nBlocked paths: \n- Right from start blocked by wall (2,5). \n- Straight down column 4: (2,4)->(3,4)->(4,4)->(5,4)# impassable. \n- Left detour (e.g., L L to (2,2)): leads to near-dead-end at row 3 col 3 # and row 4 col 2 #; can escape via col 1 but inefficient (extra backtrack ~8+ moves). \n- Upward (to row 1): open but requires looping down around walls, longer (~10+ moves). \nDead ends/traps: Navigating into col 1-2 squeezes (blocked by row 3 col 3 # and row 4 col 2 #) forces backtrack. Row 5 cols 4 and 6 create a 'gap' only at col 5 for clean down-passage. Row 7 col 4 and row 9 col 5 block lower center.\nApproaches that fail: Greedy straight-down (hits # at 5,4). Greedy left (trapped in narrow left channel). BFS-like mental search prioritizes right-shift before deep down-moves. Generic strategy: Compute net displacement, scan for local blocks in primary direction, plan minimal detour (here, right at row 3 to use col 5 'highway' down). Extensible: In other domains (e.g., mazes, routing), identify chokepoints, use 'column highways' or subgoals (e.g., 'reach row 5 col 5'), prune dead-ends early via lookahead 2-3 steps.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen path: DRDDD (minimal 5 moves, exploits col 5 open path).\n- Start: (2,4)\n- Move D: to (3,4) [empty; navigates past row 2 col 5 wall indirectly].\n- Move R: to (3,5) [empty; avoids row 3 col 3 # on left, positions for col 5 descent].\n- Move D: to (4,5) [empty; skirts row 4 col 2 #].\n- Move D: to (5,5) [empty; slips between row 5 cols 4# and 6#].\n- Move D: to (6,5) [G; clear landing].\nThis avoids all walls by shifting right early.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace:\n- Start: (2,4)\n- 1.

Player starts at row 7, column 4 (@). Goal is at row 2, column 11 (G). There are no walls (#) anywhere on the grid—all cells are empty (-) except for the player and goal positions, making it a completely open space. Key constraints: moves must stay within bounds (rows 1-12, columns 1-12); up decreases row number, down increases it, left decreases column, right increases it. Patterns: fully traversable grid with no obstacles, so pathfinding is straightforward. The required displacement is up 5 rows (7-2=5) and right 7 columns (11-4=7), for a Manhattan distance of 12 steps. Bounds are relevant near edges: from start, only 3 left moves possible before column 1, 8 right to column 12, 6 up to row 1, 5 down to row 12.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nIn an open grid, countless paths exist: any sequence of exactly 5 U and 7 R reaches the goal (total 12 moves, shortest possible). No paths are blocked since no walls. Dead ends or traps: none, as every cell is passable and no loops or penalties. General direction: primarily up and right; interleaving moves flexibly. Multiple paths: e.g., all right then up (stays in row 7 then column 11); all up then right (stays in column 4 then row 2); or zigzag (e.g., URUR...). Chosen strategy: right 7 to column 11 (efficient horizontal progress first, avoiding early bound risks), then up 5—simple, stays far from left/down bounds. Alternatives: up first reaches row 2 column 4 safely, then right along goal row. Paths to avoid: excessive left/down (e.g., LLL to column 1 wastes moves, requires 10R to compensate, longer path); going down to row 12 then up 10 wastes moves. Failed approaches: out-of-bounds moves (e.g., 9L from start hits column -2 invalid); wall-bashing (impossible here, but in walled grids, BFS/A* needed). Generic strategies: compute Manhattan distance for lower bound; model bounds as implicit walls; prioritize open directions; explore via DFS/BFS mentally (here trivial); backtrack from dead ends (none here). Extensible: in mazes, mark visited to avoid cycles; prefer low-risk paths near obstacles.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen path: 7R then 5U (12 moves total). Start: (7,4).\n- Move R: from (7,4) to (7,5); clear, progresses right.\n- Move R: from (7,5) to (7,6); clear.\n- Move R: from (7,6) to (7,7); clear.\n- Move R: from (7,7) to (7,8); clear.\n- Move R: from (7,8) to (7,9); clear.\n- Move R: from (7,9) to (7,10); clear.\n- Move R: from (7,10) to (7,11); clear, now vertically aligned with goal.\n- Move U: from (7,11) to (6,11); navigates up, open space.\n- Move U: from (6,11) to (5,11); clear.\n- Move U: from (5,11) to (4,11); clear.\n- Move U: from (4,11) to (3,11); clear.\n- Move U: from (3,11) to (2,11); reaches goal, clear.\n\nAlternate explored: 5U then 7R—from (7,4) U to (2,4), then R to (2,11)—also 12 moves, hits goal row early but requires traversing top row near right bound (safe). Rejected pure left/down as inefficient. No obstacles navigated, but strategy avoids potential bound traps.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace of RRRRRRRUUUUU:\n1. R: (7,4) -> (7,5) valid, no wall.\n2.

Walls (#) are impassable and located at the following positions:\n- Row 1: columns 4, 6\n- Row 2: column 3\n- Row 3: column 4\n- Row 4: none\n- Row 5: none (fully open)\n- Row 6: columns 7, 8\n- Row 7: columns 1, 4\n- Row 8: none (fully open)\n- Row 9: none (fully open)\n\nKey patterns and constraints: The grid is mostly open, but upper rows (1-3) have staggered walls that could block diagonal shortcuts from above. Critically, row 6 has consecutive walls at columns 7 and 8, forming a barrier that prevents direct access to the goal from the right side on row 6. Row 5 is completely open, providing a clear horizontal path. Row 7 has walls at column 1 and 4, creating a partial block in the bottom-left area. All moves must stay within rows 1-9 and columns 1-9; no diagonal moves allowed. The general vector from start to goal is left 5 units (column 8 to 3) and down 1 unit (row 5 to 6).\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations prioritize shortest, safest paths while avoiding dead ends. The optimal strategy exploits row 5's openness: move left 5 times to (5,3), then down to (6,3). This is direct (6 moves), avoids all walls, and requires no detours.\n\nMultiple possible paths exist, but many are longer or riskier:\n- Direct left on row 5 then down: unblocked, shortest.\n- Go up to row 4 (open), left to column 3, down twice: works (e.g., U LLLLL DD, 8 moves) but longer; upper walls in rows 1-3 irrelevant here but would complicate if aiming higher.\n- Go right to (5,9), down to (6,9), then left/down maneuvers: blocked—row 6 columns 8 and 7 are walls, creating a dead end. Cannot proceed left on row 6.\n- Bottom detour: From (5,9) down to (6,9), down to (7,9), left toward column 3 on row 7. But row 7 column 4 wall blocks access to column 3 from the right (can reach column 5 but not cross to 3). Further detour via row 8/9 (fully open) could loop around (e.g., down to row 8/9, left to column 1, up), but very long (20+ moves) and inefficient.\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid:\n- Immediate down from start: (6,8) is wall.\n- Row 6 right side: trapped by columns 7-8 walls; must backtrack or detour south.\n- Row 7 left: column 4 wall splits it; approaching column 3 from right impossible without row 8/9 bypass.\n- Upper walls: row 1-3 walls (e.g., row 2 col 3 directly above goal area) could trap if over-navigating up then left.\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily left (net -5 columns), minor down (+1 row). BFS-like thinking (explore breadth-wise) or A* heuristics (Manhattan distance: 6 steps minimum) favor horizontal then vertical on open row 5.\n\nApproaches that would NOT work and why:\n- Pure down then left: Initial down hits wall; even if from elsewhere, row 6 barrier blocks.\n- Rightward exploration: Pushes away from goal, leads to edge and row 6 wall trap.\n- Upward then down: Adds unnecessary vertical travel (e.g., +2 up/down = 4 extra moves).\n- Ignoring row 5 openness: Overcomplicating with bottom loops wastes moves and risks row 7 wall.\nThis teaches extensible pathfinding: Prioritize open corridors, identify barriers early, compute Manhattan distance for lower bounds, simulate short detours to validate.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: LLLLLD (direct left on row 5, then down). This navigates the open row 5 corridor around the row 6 wall barrier implicitly (by approaching goal from above).\n\n- Start: (5,8)\n  - Move L → (5,7) [empty; progresses left toward goal column]\n- Current: (5,7)\n  - Move L → (5,6) [empty]\n- Current: (5,6)\n  - Move L → (5,5) [empty]\n- Current: (5,5)\n  - Move L → (5,4) [empty]\n- Current: (5,4)\n  - Move L → (5,3) [empty; now directly above goal]\n- Current: (5,3)\n  - Move D → (6,3) [goal; no wall here, walls are at (6,7)-(6,8)]\n\nThis avoids all obstacles by staying on open row 5 until final down.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace from start (5,8):\n1. L → (5,7): row 5 col 7 empty, in bounds.\n2. L → (5,6): row 5 col 6 empty.\n3. L → (5,5): row 5 col 5 empty.\n4. L → (5,4): row 5 col 4 empty.\n5. L → (5,3): row 5 col 3 empty.\n6. D → (6,3): row 6 col 3 is G (passable), walls elsewhere on row 6.\n\nFinal position: (6,3) exactly at goal. No moves hit walls (row 5 fully open; down targets G). All positions in 1-9 bounds (columns 8→3≥1, rows 5→6). No out-of-bounds or invalid steps. Path length 6 (matches Manhattan). Alternate traces (e.g., inserting R L cancels) would work but longer; this is verified optimal and correct.

No other obstacles. The grid is mostly open space (-), with only two isolated walls far from the direct path. Patterns: Open horizontal and vertical movement possible in most areas; walls do not block the primary left-up corridor but could trap if detouring unnecessarily to top-left or bottom-mid.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nGeneral direction needed: Primarily left (6 steps to column 1) and up (1 step to row 4), for a Manhattan distance of 7 moves. Multiple paths exist due to open grid (e.g., all left then up; up then all left; interleaving left/up). Shortest paths are 7 moves.\nBlocked paths: No direct blocks between start and goal; wall at (1,3) irrelevant (too far up-right); wall at (8,4) blocks only if going down to row 8 column 4, creating a minor bottom trap.\nDead ends/traps to avoid: Going right increases column distance (away from goal); going down past row 8 risks hitting (8,4) wall, forcing detour (e.g., from row 8 col 4 blocked, must go left/right/up). No major mazes, but overcommitting down or right leads to longer paths. Top wall (1,3) could trap if going up-left excessively early, but unlikely.\nApproaches that fail:\n- Going right (R): Increases col to 12, then must backtrack 11 left + up = inefficient.\n- Going down first (D): Reaches row 11, then must backtrack up 7 + left 6 = 13+ moves, and risks (8,4).\n- Ignoring bounds: L 7 times hits col 0 (invalid).\n- Circling walls unnecessarily: e.g., down to row 8, left to col 3, blocked by (8,4), must detour up/right.\nBest strategy: Prioritize left (dominant direction), then up.

Key constraints include the wall at (3,4) blocking direct left passage on row 3 beyond column 5, wall at (4,6) blocking row 4 at column 6, and bottom walls creating potential traps if navigating too far down on the edges.

Optimal paths are 7 moves. General direction: primarily left (net 4 columns) and down (net 3 rows).\n\nBlocked paths: Cannot cross any # walls. For example, on row 3, cannot go left past column 4 due to # at (3,4), but since goal is column 5, this is navigable up to (3,5). On row 4, # at (4,6) blocks from right side unless detoured up/down.

Descending too far right risks bottom walls: # at (9,9) blocks row 9 column 9, (11,10) blocks bottom-right corner, (10,1-2) and (11,2) block bottom-left. A path going down to row 11 column 10 would be trapped (cannot go right or down, left blocked eventually).

Patterns/constraints: Dense walls in the upper half, particularly in column 3 (rows 3,4,6) forming vertical barriers, plus scattered walls like row 8 col 2, row 7 col 1, row 5 col 5 creating a maze-like structure above the start. Bottom rows (9-11) are mostly open except row 9 col 4 # directly right of start. Key constraint: cannot pass # or go out of bounds (rows 1-11, cols 1-6). Goal is adjacent but offset, requiring navigation around local wall at (9,4).\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Overall direction needed is down (to row 10) and right (to col 4), minimal movement. Multiple paths exist (e.g., direct DR, or longer detours like left-down-right-right, or up-then-around-down). Direct right (R) blocked by wall at (9,4). Down-then-right (DR) works as (10,3) is empty. Paths going up enter maze: e.g., up to (8,3) open, but then face barriers like row 8 col 2 # blocking left-up, row 7 col 1 # narrowing paths. Dead ends/traps to avoid: narrow corridors in upper maze, e.g., column 3 blocked at rows 3-4,6 forcing zigzags; row 5 col 5 # creates right-side trap if going far right-up; row 1 col 6 dead-ends top-right. If over-explore up without plan, risk looping or backtracking due to walls simulating cul-de-sacs (e.g., left from row 7 col 2 hits row 7 col 1 #). Approaches that fail: R-first (hits #); straight D then D (to row 11 col 3, misses goal); up-heavy paths inefficient as goal is down, waste moves navigating unnecessary maze. Generic strategies: Prioritize shortest path via adjacent checks/BFS mental simulation; identify local blocks first (here (9,4)# forces down-prioritization); explore alternatives systematically (right->fail, down->success, left->viable but longer, up->complex); recognize open bottom vs. walled top to bias downward; avoid greedily following 'general direction' without checking obstacles—here naive right fails, but sequencing down-right succeeds.

Walls (#) are located at:\n- Row 2, column 7\n- Row 3, column 4\n- Row 4, column 3\n- Row 6, column 2\n- Row 7, column 1\n- Row 9, column 4\n- Row 10, columns 6, 8?

Walls form barriers and potential mazes in lower rows, creating a somewhat open middle but with chokepoints and dead-end pockets in the bottom half. No walls block the top row path. Bounds: Cannot move outside row 1-10, col 1-8 (U from row1 invalid, L from col1 invalid, etc.). Manhattan distance: same row, |6-2|=4 columns left.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: The shortest and simplest path is moving left along row 1 directly to the goal (4 left moves), as the entire top row is free of walls. Multiple paths exist by detouring down into lower rows, looping around walls, and returning up, but these are longer (e.g., 10+ moves) and risk dead ends.\n\nBlocked paths: Direct down from start (row1 col6 to row2 col6) is open (-), but further progress left/down hits walls like row2 col7 # (blocks right-down), row3 col4 # (blocks central descent). Going right first (to col7 or 8 row1) open, but then down to row2 col7 # blocked.\n\nDead ends/traps: \n- Bottom-left: row7 col1 # and row6 col2 # create a pocket; entering lower left might trap if not careful.\n- Bottom-right: row9 col4 #, row9 col7 #, row10 col6 # form isolated areas.\n- Central: row3 col4 #, row4 col3 # force detours.\nApproaches to avoid: Greedy down-then-left fails quickly (e.g., down to row2 col6, left to col5 open, but left to col4 row2 open, continuing down hits clusters). BFS/DFS mentally prioritizes top-row direct path as no obstacles. Rightward detour unnecessary (extra moves to loop back). Upward impossible (out of bounds). Wall-following (right-hand rule) might work but lead to longer path hugging lower mazes.\n\nWhy certain approaches fail: Trying shortest path assuming no walls would work here, but in general, scan row first. Down-first fails because although initial down open, to reach goal requires returning up, adding distance, and risks wall traps (e.g., from row2 col6 left to row2 col3 open? row2 \"------#-\" cols1-6 -, col7#, col8- so open, but row3 col4# blocks some left paths). Exhaustive search shows direct left optimal.\nGeneral strategies extensible: 1) Compute Manhattan, check direct line-of-sight (here clear). 2) Identify open corridors (top row). 3) Flag immediate blocks (down # nearby). 4) Simulate short detours for confirmation. 5) Prioritize low-risk (no dead-end prone) paths. Transfers to pathfinding: A* heuristic, obstacle avoidance, backtracking avoidance.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Direct left along row 1 (LLLL). This navigates no obstacles, stays in open corridor.\n\nMove 1: Current row1 col6. Direction L. New position row1 col5 (empty -). Navigated: staying top row, avoiding down # at row2 col7 nearby but irrelevant.\nMove 2: Current row1 col5. L. New row1 col4 (empty). Continues straight left.\nMove 3: Current row1 col4. L. New row1 col3 (empty).\nMove 4: Current row1 col3. L. New row1 col2 (G, goal). Reached destination.\n\n# Verification\n\nTrace entire solution step-by-step:\nStart: row1 col6\n1.

Alternate trace e.g. if tried D first: row1 col6 D → row2 col6 (-) valid but not needed, then to goal would require LLL then up U, but up from row2 col3?

Primary viable path: move right along open row 2 (cols 1-4), then down to row 3 col 4, right to goal—avoids all walls efficiently.\n\nBlocked paths:\n- Direct right on row 2 stops at col 4 (wall at col 5).\n- Early down from start to row 3 col 1, then right blocked by wall at row 3 col 2.\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid:\n- Upper area (row 1): Walls at cols 3,5,6 create pockets, e.g., row 1 col 4 is accessible but surrounded (left/right/up blocked), leading to backtrack.\n- Left-bottom detour: From row 3 col 1 down to row 4 col 1, right to row 4 col 3, but wall at row 4 col 4 forces further down to row 5 or backtrack—longer (10+ moves) and risks looping.\n- Top-right walls trap if entered prematurely.\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily right (net +5 cols), slight down (+1 row). Generic strategy: Mentally map open corridors; use wall positions to identify 'chokepoints' (e.g., row 3 col 2); prioritize paths matching Manhattan heuristic; explore alternatives by simulating 1-2 moves ahead to detect dead ends early. BFS-like mental search: breadth-first enumerate short paths, prune blocked branches.\n\nApproaches that fail and why:\n- Greedy right/down: Hits row 2 col 5 wall immediately after 4 rights.\n- Down-first: Hits row 3 col 2 wall, forces costly detour south (extra 4-6 moves).\n- Up-first to row 1: Navigable to col 1-2 or col 4, but col 4 is dead-end pocket; requires backtrack down, adding 2-4 moves.\n- Bottom loop: Viable but inefficient (e.g., down to row 5, right across, up—12+ moves), wastes space.\n\nExtensible strategies: In pathfinding domains (grids, mazes, graphs), (1) Parse environment into open/blocked cells; (2) Identify barriers and bypass routes; (3) Heuristics like Manhattan guide; (4) Simulate moves to validate; (5) Avoid sinks by checking escape paths ahead; transfers to robotics, games, optimization.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Exploit row 2's open path to col 4 (safest rightward progress), drop to row 3 col 4 (open corridor to goal), right twice. Avoids dead ends; optimal length.\n\n1. Current: row 2 col 1. Move R. New: row 2 col 2 (empty). Navigates initial open space.\n2. Current: row 2 col 2. Move R. New: row 2 col 3 (empty). Continues safe right corridor.\n3. Current: row 2 col 3. Move R. New: row 2 col 4 (empty). Reaches drop point, avoids impending row 2 col 5 wall.\n4. Current: row 2 col 4. Move D. New: row 3 col 4 (empty). Bypasses row 3 col 2 wall by approaching from above-right.\n5. Current: row 3 col 4. Move R. New: row 3 col 5 (empty). Enters final goal corridor.\n6. Current: row 3 col 5. Move R. New: row 3 col 6 (G).

Key constraints include impassable walls blocking direct left movement from start and a wall to the right in the starting row. Upper walls (rows 1-2) create minor obstacles if moving upward, but the goal is below, so downward movement is primary. No walls block the lower rows (5-7) entirely. Bounds: rows 1-7, columns 1-10; moves must stay within. Manhattan distance: 3 down + 2 right = 5 moves minimum.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Multiple paths exist due to open lower grid (e.g., go right then down, or down then right, or zigzag). General direction: primarily down (net +3 rows) and right (net +2 columns) to reach goal.\n\nBlocked paths: Cannot move left from start (row 4, col 2 is #). Row 4 has a wall at col 7, limiting far-right movement in that row. Upper walls block some upward exploration (e.g., row 2 col 3 # prevents passing up through col 3).\n\nDead ends/traps: Moving up from start leads to a larger open area but walls create potential loops or detours (e.g., row 1 col 5 # blocks top-center); not a true dead end but inefficient as it moves away from goal, requiring backtracking (extra moves). No major traps in lower grid.\n\nApproaches that would fail:\n- Left-first (L): Hits wall at (4,2).\n- Upward detour then down: Works but longer (e.g., U then navigate around walls and back down adds 2+ moves).\n- Right beyond col 7 in row 4: Hits # at (4,7), forcing down or left earlier.\n- Staying in upper rows: Doesn't progress to goal.\nGeneric strategies: Prioritize shortest path via BFS-like thinking (explore level-by-level by distance); compute net displacement; visualize/mentally map open corridors; identify local blocks and route around; test alternates mentally to confirm optimality; avoid backtracking by heading toward goal directionally.\n\nChosen path: Right along row 4 to align column, then straight down (efficient, avoids all walls, minimal moves).\nAlternate viable paths: Down first then right (e.g., DDRRR: down to row 7 col 3, right to col 5); mixes like RDDRD.

All other cells are empty (-), passable by the player.\n\nKey patterns and constraints: The grid is mostly open space with no walls obstructing the left side or upper rows. Walls are clustered on the right side (top and bottom), creating potential blockages only for paths going far right. The player needs to move primarily left (5 columns) and down (1 row), with Manhattan distance of 6 moves. No diagonal moves allowed; only orthogonal U/D/L/R. Bounds must be respected: cannot move up from row 1, down from row 7, left of column 1, or right of column 11. Walls are impassable.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple possible paths exist due to open space: (1) Go left along row 1 to column 1, then down to goal (LLLLLD, 6 moves). (2) Go down to row 2 column 6 first, then left to column 1 (DLLLLL, 6 moves). (3) Hybrid paths like LLDDLL (but longer or same). Shortest paths are 6 moves, matching Manhattan distance.\n\nBlocked paths: Cannot pass through walls at (1,9), (6,9), (6,10). For example, going right from start: R to (1,7), R to (1,8), then R blocked by (1,9). To loop around right to goal would require going down, right to column 11, down to row 7, left across bottom (avoiding row 6 col 9-10 by going to col 11 then left), up to row 2 col 1—extremely long (20+ moves), inefficient.\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid: Venturing right/down into bottom-right corner near row 6 col 9-10 walls could trap if not careful, e.g., reaching row 6 col 10 blocked right/down/left partially, forcing backtrack. But since goal is upper-left, avoid right/down altogether. No true dead ends on left/top paths.\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily left (net -5 columns), slightly down (net +1 row).

Visualize/mentally map obstacles relative to start-goal line. Prioritize moves reducing distance (left/down here). Avoid obstacle clusters. Consider shortest path via grid search mentally (BFS levels). Backtrack from dead ends. Transferable: In other domains (mazes, graphs), use distance heuristics, obstacle avoidance, explore breadth-first for optimality.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Direct left along top row (open), then down—avoids all walls, minimal moves, no backtracking needed.\n- Start: row 1, col 6\n- Move L: to row 1, col 5 (empty -)\n- Move L: to row 1, col 4 (empty -)\n- Move L: to row 1, col 3 (empty -)\n- Move L: to row 1, col 2 (empty -)\n- Move L: to row 1, col 1 (empty -)\n- Move D: to row 2, col 1 (goal G)\n\nObstacles navigated: None directly; stayed clear of right-side walls by moving left immediately.\n\n# Verification\n\nTrace entire solution LLLLLD:\n1.

Failing approaches: (1) Straight down column 3 then right works but longer horizontally late; (2) Down column 4 fails at (7,4)# -- teaches checking full vertical paths for walls; (3) Excessive right to column 7+ then down hits (6,7)#; (4) Upward moves wasteful as goal is below.

Top row (1) has walls at col 1 and 6, blocking direct left from start beyond col 7. Lower rows have clustered walls (e.g., row 5 cols 2-3, row 7 cols 7-8) creating potential traps if going too far down/left. Manhattan distance: 3 down, 2 left (minimum 5 moves).

Row 5 has a wall at col 3 blocking rightward progress from start. Row 6 has wall at col 2, isolating left side. Lower rows (7-9) are mostly open, with minor walls in row 8 col 3 and row 9 col 2, creating a 'highway' on row 7 for rightward movement. Player must navigate around mid-level walls to reach goal, staying within row 1-9, col 1-4 bounds. No diagonal moves; only orthogonal U/D/L/R.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nGeneral direction needed: Slightly down then right across open row 7, then up to goal—net movement: +1 row, +3 columns.\n\nMultiple possible paths: Primary viable path goes down to row 7 (fully open), right to col 4, up to goal. Alternative: Down to row 7 col 3, up to row 6 col 3, right to goal (same length).

Can't descend from row 4 col 3 (down to 5,3 #).\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid:\n- Upper left (rows 1-5 cols 1-2): Cul-de-sac; no path to goal without backtracking through walls.\n- Row 6 col 1: Can't go right (# at 6,2); forces down to row 7 or back up.\n- Row 8 col 4 and row 9 cols 3-4: Accessible but unnecessary detour; row 9 col 2 # could trap if go too left.\n\nApproaches that fail and why:\n- Greedy rightward: Hits 5,3 # immediately.\n- Upward exploration: Wastes moves in walled-off top; no goal access.\n- Staying high (rows 4-5): Perpetual block by 5,3 # and 6,2 #.\n- Bottom loop (rows 8-9): Works but longer (extra D/D then U/U); risks row 8,3 # or row 9,2 # dead ends.\n\nOptimal strategy: Prioritize vertical drop to open row 7 highway (avoids all mid-walls), horizontal traverse, precise up to goal. This extensible: Identify 'blockers' (walls), find 'corridors' (open rows/cols), plan net displacement with detours only as needed. In other domains: Scan for chokepoints, prioritize low-obstacle zones, simulate short detours vs. blocks.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Drop down to row 7 (open corridor), right to col 4, up to goal.

Player starts at (row 5, col 6). Goal at (row 3, col 4). Wall locations: (1,2), (3,1), (3,5), (3,7), (5,3), (5,7). \n\nPatterns/constraints: The grid is mostly open ('-'), with sparse walls creating partial barriers. Row 3 has walls at cols 1,5,7, blocking direct left-right traversal in the middle-right (wall at 3,5 separates col4 goal from col6). Row 5 has walls at cols 3 and 7, limiting bottom-row movement (can't pass col3 from right, can't go right of start). Row 1 has a single wall at col2. Row 2 and 4 are fully open. Player needs to move up 2 rows and left 2 columns generally, but must navigate around bottom-right confinement and row 3's central wall at (3,5). No diagonal moves; stay in bounds (rows 1-5, cols 1-7).\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist due to open rows 2 and 4, allowing detours. Optimal paths are ~4 moves (Manhattan distance 4, no major detours needed). \n\nBlocked paths: Direct right from start hits (5,7)#; left past (5,4) hits (5,3)#; up-up to (3,6) then left blocked by (3,5)#. \n\nDead ends/traps: (3,6) is semi-trapped (can't left/right, must backtrack up to row 2 or down). Bottom-left corner around (5,3)# dead-ends if overcommitted left. Top wall at (1,2) irrelevant here. Avoid right side of row 3 (cols 6-7 trapped by walls). \n\nGeneral direction: Primarily up (to clear row 5 wall at col3) and left (to reach col4), prioritizing left in row 5 to bypass (5,3)# before ascending, as row 4 is open. \n\nFailing approaches: (1) Up-first (UU to 3,6) traps on row 3 right, requiring detour up to row 2, left across, down (longer, ~6+ moves). (2) Right-anytime fails immediately at (5,7)# or (3,7)#. (3) Down/out-of-bounds invalid. (4) Left-only (LLL from start) hits (5,3)# dead-end. (5) Ignoring row 3 wall, assuming direct L from (3,6) fails. \n\nGeneric strategies: Mentally model as graph (positions as nodes, moves as edges, #/bounds prune); prioritize shortest path via BFS-like exploration (check neighbors level-by-level). Identify chokepoints (row 3 col5 wall splits east-west); choose side with open access (west via row 5 cols4-6). Pre-scan obstacles in target row/column. Test alternates: simulate 2-3 paths, prune dead-ends early. Extensible: Applies to mazes/games/AI pathfinding (A* with heuristics like Manhattan), robotics (obstacle avoidance), planning (resource-constrained routing).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: LLUU (left along row 5 to col4, then up through open row4 to goal; avoids all walls, direct). \n\n- Start: (5,6). Move L → (5,5) ('-', navigates around future (5,3)# by stopping at col4). \n- Current: (5,5). Move L → (5,4) ('-', now aligned with goal column). \n- Current: (5,4). Move U → (4,4) ('-', row4 open, ascends safely). \n- Current: (4,4). Move U → (3,4) (G, row3 col4 open). \n\nAlternate explored (UL LU): U to (4,6), L to (4,5), L to (4,4), U to (3,4) also works (same length), but LLUU clearer as it aligns column first. Longer detour (UU LLL D from 3,6) works but inefficient.\n\n# Verification\n\nTrace full path LLUU: \n1. Start (5,6). \n2. L → (5,5): in bounds, '-' (no #). \n3. L → (5,4): in bounds, '-' (avoids (5,3)#). \n4. U → (4,4): in bounds, '-' (row4 open). \n5. U → (3,4): in bounds, G (no # at (3,5)). \n\nEnd at (3,4) exactly.

Obstacles are sparse but strategically placed: top-middle blockers in rows 1-2 prevent direct rightward movement into column 4 early; left-side walls in row 6 col 1 and row 9 col 1 block far-left descent; bottom walls in row 9 col 4 and row 11 col 2/7 create minor hazards far below the goal but irrelevant for shortest paths.

Far-left descent (e.g., LLDDDDD...) works but longer (requires extra right moves later, avoiding row6 col1 #).

Overshooting down past row 6 then up (inefficient, risks bottom walls). Generic lesson: Identify local blockers (row2 col4), find bypass windows (row3 col4 open), prioritize net displacement while sequencing lateral moves post-blocker.\n\nExtensible strategies: Visualize/manually BFS from start, marking reachable cells level-by-level; note minimal moves (Manhattan 6, no shortcuts); prune dead-ends by checking 3+ directions blocked; transfer to mazes by prioritizing open corridors, avoiding edge-hugging unless forced.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: DDRDDD (bypasses blocker explicitly by moving right only after clearing row 2).\n\n- Current: row1 col3.

No diagonal moves; must stay within bounds (rows 1-5, columns 1-9); walls are impassable. General constraint: path must primarily move left (net 3 columns left) with minimal vertical adjustment (net 1 row down). This setup resembles a simple maze with chokepoints, teaching that open corridors (like row 2) are efficient paths while walls force detours.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations emphasize systematic pathfinding applicable to any grid-based navigation (e.g., mental BFS or DFS with backtracking):\n- Multiple possible paths exist: Shortest paths (4 moves) include entering row 2 early via column 8 or 9, then moving left along the open row 2 corridor to the goal.

Lower paths blocked by row 3 col 7-8 ## and row 4 col 3-4 ##, forcing zigzags.\n- Dead ends/traps to avoid: From row 1 col 8, left is # (trap if overcommitted leftward). Row 3 col 9 leads to # at col 8 (dead end; must backtrack down/up). Row 5 col 1 # blocks far left; row 4 col 3-4 creates a cul-de-sac if entered carelessly. Generic strategy: Preview 1-2 moves ahead to detect blocks; prioritize open rows/columns toward goal (here, row 2 is fully open except goal).\n- General direction: Primarily left (to col 6) with one down to row 2; avoid excessive down/right (out of bounds or away from goal).\n- Failed approaches: Greedy left fails (hits row 1 col 7 #). Greedy down to row 5 then left hits row 5 col 1 # and row 4 walls, requiring backtrack (inefficient). Ignoring bounds (e.g., up from row 1 or right from col 9) invalid. Overly complex bottom loop works but wastes moves, teaching value of shortest-path mindset (e.g., Manhattan distance heuristic: |2-1| + |6-9| = 1+3=4 minimum moves).\n\nExtensible strategies: (1) Decompose into subgoals (e.g., 'reach row 2 open space'). (2) Eliminate invalid moves first (check adjacent cells). (3) Simulate alternatives briefly to prune dead ends. (4) Verify net displacement matches goal.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: LDL L (enters row 2 via col 8 for safety, exploiting row 2 openness).

No other obstacles block direct paths to the goal.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Manhattan distance is 4 moves (2 up + 2 right), so shortest paths are 4 moves. Multiple possible paths exist due to open grid, e.g., RRUU, UURR, RURU, URUR, etc. All mixes of 2R and 2U in any order work because the top rows (1-3) are completely empty across all columns. Paths blocked: None directly to goal, but the walls in (4,4) and (5,4) block straight down-right if descending; e.g., from (3,4) down would hit wall at (4,4), but irrelevant for goal path. Dead ends/traps: Minimal; the walls create a narrow blockage, but player can detour left (cols 1-3) or right (col 5). Going down into lower rows (6+) leads to long detours but no true dead ends since bottom is open—however, inefficient as goal is up/top. General direction: Primarily up (to row 1) and right (to col 3). Approaches that fail: (1) Going left from start (to col 1 row 3)—hits left bound quickly, requires extra right moves later, wasteful. (2) Going down first (e.g., DDDD)—takes player far from goal, risks wall if then R to col 4 rows 4-5, and requires many U to recover; inefficient, potential for looping in open space. (3) Over-right to col 5 then left—extra moves. Best: Stay in top rows, combine U and R without descending. Generic strategy extensible: Compute Manhattan distance for lower bound; visualize/prioritize direct moves toward goal; identify obstacles and pre-plan detours (e.g., A* or BFS mentally: expand from start, avoid walls/bounds); prune inefficient directions (away from goal); explore alternates briefly to confirm optimality.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: RRUU (direct right then up; 4 moves, shortest).

Generic strategy: always map positions explicitly, note obstacles relative to start/goal, and identify 'chokepoints' like this wall.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: The goal is immediately above and to the right (up 1, right 1 net movement), so general direction is up and right. Multiple paths exist due to open space: shortest is up then right (UR); alternatives include left to (4,1) then up to (3,1) then right-right to (3,3) (LURR, longer); or up-up then right-down-right (UURDR, circuitous). Blocked paths: direct right from start hits wall at (4,3), so R first fails immediately. From (4,2) down is out of bounds (row 5 invalid). Dead ends/traps: none, as upper rows are fully open—no loops or blocks leading to isolation. However, lingering on bottom row right of wall (e.g., somehow to (4,4)) requires going left around wall or up elsewhere, but inefficient. Approaches that fail: greedy rightward push ignores wall, crashes; ignoring bounds (e.g., repeated D) exits grid; random moves waste steps without progress. Better: prioritize net displacement toward goal, check adjacent cells first. Generic extensible strategy: visualize/mentally simulate grid as coordinate plane; enumerate 1-2 step options, prune invalids; consider obstacles as 'forced detours'; for larger grids, BFS/DFS mentally or systematically explores without backtracking losses; always compute Manhattan distance (here |4-3| + |2-3| = 2) as lower bound, seek minimal exceeding it only if needed.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: UR (shortest, direct, avoids wall). \n- Start at (4,2). Move U (up): target (3,2) is -, no obstacle, within bounds → new position (3,2). Navigates above the wall indirectly by vertical move.\n- From (3,2), move R (right): target (3,3) is G, passable, no obstacle, within bounds → new position (3,3). Direct to goal, row 3 open.\nThis path succeeds by first clearing the wall's row, then horizontal.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace:\n1. Start: (4,2)\n2. U: to (3,2) — cell -, row 3≥1, col2 1-5, no wall → ok, now (3,2)\n3. R: to (3,3) — cell G (passable), row3 1-4, col3 1-5, no wall → ok, now (3,3)\nEnd at goal exactly. No walls hit, all bounds respected, no invalid moves. Confirmed error-free (alternates like RU invalid: R from (4,2) to (4,3)# blocked). Generic: retrace verifies coherence; if error, backtrack and iterate.\n\n# Solution\n\nUR</think>\n\n{\"solution\": \"UR\"}"}],"llmPathLength":2}

Player starts at row 9, column 2 (@). Goal at row 7, column 1 (G). Key wall locations:\n- Row 1: columns 1, 4\n- Row 3: columns 4, 6\n- Row 6: columns 1, 5, 6\n- Row 8: column 2\n\nPatterns and constraints: The grid is mostly open with sparse walls. Critical local constraint: wall at (8,2) directly blocks upward movement from start. Wall at (6,1) blocks access to goal from above on column 1, so path must approach goal from below (row 8, column 1) or right (row 7, column 2). No diagonal moves; must stay in bounds (rows 1-10, columns 1-6). General direction: primarily up (decrease row by 2) and left (decrease column by 1), but requires detour due to wall.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Shortest path requires minimal moves (Manhattan distance 3: 2 up, 1 left), but direct up blocked. Two main detour options: left then up (column 1 corridor open from row 10 to 7), or right/up then left (longer, navigates row 8 open cells but blocked by (8,2)# from right-to-left on row 8).\n\n- Multiple paths: Left detour (LUU, 3 moves); right detour example (R U L U L U or similar, 6+ moves).\n- Blocked paths: Direct U hits (8,2)# (impassable wall). Going down (D) or far right then up risks longer paths or dead ends near row 6 walls (e.g., (6,5)# and (6,6)# trap right side).\n- Dead ends/traps: Right side upper grid has row 6 walls creating partial block; entering row 6 column 5-6 leads to no further progress without backtracking. Column 1 above row 6 blocked by (6,1)#.\n- General direction: Up and left; prioritize column 1 ascent as it's open below goal.\n- Failed approaches: Greedy up-first fails immediately on wall. Right-heavy ignores shorter left option, inefficient. Over-up (past row 7) unnecessary and risks upper walls (row 3/1). No flooding/jumping walls. BFS-like mental search favors shortest unblocked paths; left detour wins as column 1 is clear corridor (rows 7-10, column 1 all passable).\n\nGeneric strategies: Visualize grid mentally or sketch; identify immediate blocks and local bypasses. Prioritize directions toward goal (up/left here). Explore branches: test direct, then detours (left vs. right). Avoid dead ends by checking forward visibility (e.g., column 1 clear to goal). Use Manhattan + obstacles for heuristic. Transferable: Modular pathfinding (local solve then global), backtrack on blocks, prefer open corridors.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Left detour (shortest, direct corridor). Avoids all walls, minimal moves.\n\n- Start: (9,2)\n- Move L: to (9,1) [open -, navigates around implicit block ahead]\n- Move U: to (8,1) [open -, bypasses (8,2)# wall]\n- Move U: to (7,1) [G, goal reached, open path from below]\n\nAlternate explored: Right path (e.g., R to (9,3), U to (8,3), but then L blocked by (8,2)#, requires U to (7,3) then L L to (7,1); longer (RU LLU? Wait, from (8,3) L to (8,2)# invalid, so R U U L L: (9,2)->(9,3)->(8,3)->(7,3)->(7,2)->(7,1), 5 moves, works but suboptimal).\n\n# Verification\n\nTrace full solution LUU:\n1. Start (9,2)\n2.

No walls hit (bypassed (8,2)#). All moves valid (no out-of-bounds: col1 >=1, row7 >=1). No errors. Alternate right path verified longer but valid, confirms no traps in solution path.

No other walls. \n\nPatterns/constraints: The grid is mostly open, especially in the lower half (rows 4-9), with walls concentrated in the upper half (rows 1-3) and two in row 8 (cols 4 and 6). This suggests the upper area might create maze-like distractions or potential loops, but the goal is nearby in the lower area. Key constraints: cannot pass # or go out of bounds (rows 1-9, cols 1-6). Direct Manhattan distance is 2 down + 1 right = 3 moves minimum. Lower walls in row 8 cols 4/6 block direct access to row 9 from right side but leave left/center open.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Net movement needed is primarily down (row 7 to 9) with a slight right shift (col 1 to 2). Multiple shortest paths exist (e.g., DRD, RDD, DDR), all length 3, staying in the open lower-left area. Paths blocked: Any attempting to drop down from row 7 col 4+ into row 8 col 4/6 hits # (e.g., from row 7 col 6 down to row 8 col 6 #). Dead ends/traps: Going right to row 7 col 6 then down is blocked (#), forcing backtrack left/up; upper maze (rows 1-3) has fragmented walls (e.g., row 1 cols 2/4 # block direct left-right, row 3 col 4 # creates partial barrier), potentially trapping if overcommitted upward (e.g., reaching row 2 col 6 # dead-ends right side). Avoid by not going up from start. General direction: down then right (or variants). \n\nApproaches that fail: 1) Pure down then right (DDR) works but if mistakenly DD from col 1 to row 9 col 1 then over-right hits nothing but longer unnecessary. 2) Going up first (e.g., U to row 6 col 1) leads away from goal, into open but distant space, risking navigation into upper walls (e.g., trying row 1 col 1 right hits row 1 col 2 #). 3) Far-right path (RRRRR to row 7 col 6, D blocked by row 8 col 6 #, forcing long detour left/up/down). 4) Out-of-bounds: L from col 1 or R from col 6. Generic strategies: Mentally map local obstacles first (check 3x3 around start/goal), prioritize minimal moves toward goal direction, explore alternatives via mental BFS (branching paths), identify chokepoints (row 8 cols 1-3 open, 4/6 blocked), avoid opposite direction unless necessary. This transfers to domains like chess (control center), routing (avoid tolls), or search problems (prune away-from-goal branches).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: DRD (direct, navigates around no obstacles, shortest).

Exploring bottom rows 8-9 leads to loops but no permanent dead ends since open. General direction: Primarily down (5 net steps) with minor right adjustment; stay in columns 3-4 to avoid left walls.

Alternatives include left on row 3 to col 2, then down and left (6 moves), or detours up/right/down (longer, 10+ moves).\n- Blocked paths: Direct left on row 3 fails after 3 lefts (hits # at row 3 col 1). Cannot pass row 1 col 2 or row 6 col 4 without detours.\n- Dead ends/traps: \n  - Top-left (row 1 col 1-2): walled off partially, hard to escape if entered unnecessarily.\n  - Bottom-right open areas (row 5-6 cols 8-11): spacious but far from goal, risks looping without progress.\n  - Narrow corridors like row 2 cols 9-11 or row 5 cols 1-6: not trapping but inefficient.\n- General direction: Left-dominant (to col 1) with minor down adjustment. Prioritize entering row 4 early, as it's a clear path leftward.\n- Failing approaches:\n  - All-left first: Hits wall at row 3 col 1; cannot reach goal without backtracking (inefficient).\n  - All-down first: From row 3 col 5 down to row 6 col 5 open, but row 6 col 4 # forces right detour, then up multiple rows—long and risky dead end.\n  - Up-right detours: Row 1-2 have walls (e.g., row 2 col 8 #), leading to mazelike wandering far from goal.\n- Generic strategies: Mentally model as graph (cells as nodes, edges to adjacent empties). Use BFS-like thinking for shortest path: explore breadth-first mentally. Identify 'highways' (open rows/cols like row 4 cols 1-7). Avoid greedily following one direction; check for walls 1-2 steps ahead. Prune long detours by Manhattan distance heuristic (here |4-1| + |3-4| = 5 minimum moves). Test invariants: stay south-west generally.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Down first to enter row 4 highway, then left to goal. Shortest, no backtracking.\n\n1.

No walls or obstacles block the direct path from start to goal. The required movement is 3 steps up (to decrease row from 8 to 5) and 5 steps left (to decrease column from 9 to 4), totaling a minimum of 8 moves. Bounds are strict: cannot go above row 1, below row 10, left of column 1, or right of column 12. The walls are irrelevant as they are far from the path and unreachable without unnecessary detours.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple possible paths: Any sequence combining exactly 3 'U' and 5 'L' will reach the goal in 8 moves, as there are no obstacles in the 6x8 subgrid spanning rows 5-8 and columns 4-9. Paths can interleave ups and lefts freely.\nBlocked paths: None directly; the only walls are at (1,12) and (2,12), which would require going right 3 times and up/down significantly, irrelevant here.\nDead ends/traps: None exist. The open grid means no cul-de-sacs. Even detours (e.g., right or down) are recoverable but longer.\nGeneral direction: Primarily up (net -3 rows) and left (net -5 columns). Optimal Manhattan distance: 8 moves.\nApproaches that would fail:\n- Going down ('D'): Increases row away from goal (e.g., to row 10), requiring correction later, but possible in open grid—wasteful.\n- Going right ('R'): Increases column to 12, then bounds limit further right; walls at col12 rows1-2 block only if going there, but path to goal requires left anyway—leads to longer paths.\n- Over-up: From row 8, 7+ ups hit row 1 bound before goal.\n- Over-left: From col 9, 9 lefts hit col 1, but only 5 needed.\n- Ignoring bounds: e.g., UUUUUUUU from start hits row 1 after 7U, cannot reach goal.\nChosen strategy: Go left fully to column 4 first (LLLLL), staying in row 8 (safe), then up to row 5 (UUU). This hugs the bottom then vertical climb, avoiding any hypothetical bound issues (none here). Alternative: Ups first (UUU then LLLLL) hugs right side.

Row 5 is completely passable (G--@- translates to column 1: G, 2: -, 3: -, 4: @, 5: -; all non-wall). Player and goal are on the same row, separated by 3 empty cells. Walls do not intersect the direct path on row 5. The open lower and upper areas allow detours, but walls create minor blockages below (e.g., cannot pass row 6 col 3 or row 7 col 1). Bounds: rows 1-9, columns 1-5; moves out of bounds invalid.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations:\n- Multiple paths exist due to the open grid, including direct left (shortest: 3 moves), upward detours via row 4 (e.g., U L L L D, 5 moves), downward via row 6 (e.g., D L L L U, but navigates around wall at row 6 col 3?

For example, from row 5 col 4, D L attempts row 6 col 3 (#)—blocked. Row 7 col 1 (#) blocks direct under-goal access from row 7.\n- Dead ends/traps to avoid: \n  - Row 6 col 3 (#) traps naive down-left moves.\n  - Row 7 col 1 (#) creates a dead end for bottom-left approaches (e.g., reach row 7 col 2, cannot L to col 1).\n  - Right edge (col 5) then down to rows 8-9 leads to open but distant areas, requiring long return (wasteful).\n  - Upper wall at row 3 col 2 minor, but unnecessary detour.\n- General direction needed: Primarily left (Manhattan distance: 0 vertical, 3 horizontal left). Minimal vertical movement ideal.\n- Approaches that would NOT work and why:\n  - Direct down then left: D to (6,4), L to (6,3) hits #—fails.\n  - Down to row 7 leftward: D D to (7,4), L L L hits row 7 col 1 #—cannot reach goal without backtracking up.\n  - Up then left across top: Possible but 2x longer (e.g., U U U U L L L D D D D), inefficient.\n  - Right first: R to (5,5), then must loop back L L L L—worse.\n\nGeneric reasoning strategies (extensible to other domains):\n- Compute Manhattan distance (here 3) as lower bound; seek path of that length.\n- Check direct line-of-sight first (row/column alignment).\n- Mentally simulate BFS layers: Level 1 moves from start, check if goal reachable without walls.\n- Identify obstacles relative to start-goal vector; classify as 'irrelevant' (row 3 col 2), 'detour-required if chosen path' (row 6 col 3), 'trap' (row 7 col 1).\n- Prune by heuristics: Avoid increasing distance unnecessarily; prefer paths reducing Manhattan.\n- For larger grids/AI: Use A* with Manhattan heuristic; here mental equivalent suffices.\n- Transferable: Always verify bounds, explore 1-step failures early to avoid deep dead ends.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Direct left along row 5 (shortest, no obstacles, minimal risk).\n- Current position: row 5, col 4.\n  Direction: L\n  New position: row 5, col 3 (empty -, no obstacle).\n- Current position: row 5, col 3.\n  Direction: L\n  New position: row 5, col 2 (empty -, no obstacle).\n- Current position: row 5, col 2.\n  Direction: L\n  New position: row 5, col 1 (G, goal reached; no obstacle navigated).\n\nAlternate explored (for learning): Down detour fails quickly—D to (6,4) ok, but next L hits # at (6,3), forcing R or U backtrack.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace of solution \"LLL\":\n- Start: (5,4) valid.\n- Move 1: L → (5,3): col 3 >=1, <=5; cell -, no #.\n- Position after step 1: (5,3).\n- Move 2: L → (5,2): col 2 >=1, <=5; cell -, no #.\n- Position after step 2: (5,2).\n- Move 3: L → (5,1): col 1 >=1, <=5; cell G (passable goal), no #.\n- Position after step 3: (5,1) exactly goal.\n\nAll moves within bounds (row 5 fixed, cols 4→3→2→1 all 1-5).

Player starts at row 5, column 4 (@). Goal is at row 10, column 2 (G). \n\nWall locations:\n- Row 1, columns 1 and 2: ##\n- Row 4, column 4: #\n- Row 6, columns 2 and 3: ##\n- Row 7, columns 2 and 3: ##\n- Row 8, column 3: #\n\nPatterns and constraints: The grid is very narrow (only 4 columns), creating corridor-like navigation. Key blockages include upper-left walls (row 1 cols 1-2), a wall blocking direct down from start in column 4 (row 4 col 4), a major barrier in the lower-middle (rows 6-7 cols 2-3 fully blocked ##, plus row 8 col 3 #), forcing paths to skirt around via column 1 (left) or column 4 (right). Rows 2-3 and 9-11 are mostly or fully open. All moves must stay within bounds (rows 1-11, cols 1-4), avoid # walls, and use only U (up: decrease row), D (down: increase row), L (left: decrease col), R (right: increase col). No diagonals. Manhattan distance: 5 down + 2 left = 7 moves minimum.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Net movement needed is +5 rows down and -2 columns left. Multiple paths exist, but optimal ones avoid the lower-middle wall cluster (rows 6-8 cols 2-3). \n\n- Primary viable paths: (1) Stay in open column 4, go down to row 10 col 4, then left along open row 10 to col 2 (shortest, 7 moves). (2) Go left along row 5 to col 1, down column 1 (fully open) to row 10 col 1, then right to col 2 (longer, ~8-10 moves). Mixtures like down to row 8 col 4, left to col 1 via row 9, then adjust also work but not shorter.\n\n- Blocked paths: Direct down from start in cols 2-3 impossible (row 5 col 3/2 open, but row 6 col 3/2 = #). Cannot cross lower-middle barrier (rows 6-7 cols 2-3 ##); must go below row 8 or around top (impractical). Upper path via rows 2-4 open but requires going up first (U blocked at start by row 4 col 4 #), leading to detours >7 moves.\n\n- Dead ends/traps to avoid: No true traps (grid acyclic-ish, no loops leading to blocks), but pseudo-dead ends like entering row 5 col 3 then trying D (hits row 6 col 3 #, must backtrack L or U). Going up into row 1 cols 3-4 dead-ends left due to row 1 cols 1-2 ## and no down path bypassing lower walls efficiently. Column 1 down is safe but long. Row 8 col 3 # blocks leftward from col 4 at row 8.\n\n- General direction: Prioritize down column 4 (consistently open: rows 6-10 col 4 all -), then left at row 10 (open cols 1-4 except G is passable).\n\n- Failed approaches: Greedy left-first (e.g., L L from start to row 5 col 2, then D hits # at row 6 col 2; forces further L to col 1 + many downs = longer). Straight down then left too early (e.g., after 2 D to row 7 col 4, L to row 7 col 3 impossible, it's #). Upward exploration wastes moves (cannot U from start). BFS-like mental search (explore level-by-level by depth) reveals shortest is right-wall hugging down then left.\n\nGeneric strategies: Decompose into subgoals (e.g., 'reach bottom row via open column, then horizontal'). Check 1-2 moves ahead for blocks. Prefer columns/rows with longest open stretches (col 4 down, row 10 left). Avoid greedy (local optima like early left) by simulating dead ends. Extensible: In larger mazes, use A* with heuristic (Manhattan), wall-following (right-hand rule here hugs col 4), or pattern recognition (blockages force flanking routes).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: DDDDLL (down column 4 to row 10 col 4, avoiding left walls, then left across open row 10).\n\n- Start: row 5, col 4\n- Move 1: D → row 6, col 4 (- empty); skirts left walls at row 6 cols 2-3 ##\n- Move 2: D → row 7, col 4 (- empty); continues avoiding row 7 cols 2-3 ##\n- Move 3: D → row 8, col 4 (- empty); dodges row 8 col 3 #\n- Move 4: D → row 9, col 4 (- empty); row 9 fully open\n- Move 5: D → row 10, col 4 (- empty); now at bottom, row 10 mostly open\n- Move 6: L → row 10, col 3 (- empty); horizontal shift left\n- Move 7: L → row 10, col 2 (G goal)\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace:\n- Start: (5,4)\n- 1.

No major loops/traps; open grid. Going to row 6 unnecessarily risks wall but avoidable.\nGeneral direction: Primarily DOWN (net +4 rows), slight RIGHT (+2 cols).

Player starts at row 1, column 6 (@). Goal at row 10, column 9 (G). Walls (#) at specific positions: row 3 col 4; row 5 col 1; row 6 col 4; row 7 col 2; row 8 col 1; row 8 col 5. All other cells are empty (-). Patterns/constraints: Walls are clustered on the left and middle-left side, creating potential barriers in early columns but leaving the right side (especially column 9) completely open from row 1 to row 10. No walls in column 9 at all. Grid bounds must be respected: cannot move outside rows 1-11 or columns 1-9. General movement: U (row-1), D (row+1), L (col-1), R (col+1). Impassable walls force path deviations.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist due to the mostly open grid. Primary strategic consideration: overall direction is down (net +9 rows) and right (net +3 columns). Simplest path leverages the completely open column 9: move right to column 9 first (3 rights), then down to row 10 (9 downs). This avoids all walls entirely.\n\nAlternative paths: (1) Down column 6 first (9 downs to row 10 col 6, all open), then right 3 to goal—also works, but mixes directions. (2) Zigzag paths, e.g., down to row 4 col 6, right to col 9, down rest. All viable since right/middle columns are clear.\n\nBlocked paths: Cannot pass through any #. For example, straight left from start hits walls like row 5 col 1 or row 7 col 2. Down-left paths risk dead ends, e.g., reaching row 8 col 1 (# blocks further left/down). Trying to go up from start fails (out of bounds).\n\nDead ends/traps: Left side forms mild mazes—e.g., row 8 col 1 # and col 5 # create pockets; entering row 7 col 2 area leads to backtracking. Avoid by staying right/center. General direction: Prioritize right to open column, then down.\n\nApproaches that fail: (1) Ignoring bounds—e.g., RRRR from start goes to col 10 (invalid). (2) Assuming walls block right—they don't. (3) Greedy down-only then left—works but longer if misrighted. (4) No pathfinding—brute force all sequences inefficient on larger grids. Generic strategies: Visualize columns/rows for chokepoints; check vertical highways (open columns); use subgoals (e.g., 'reach col 9'); explore breadth-first mentally to find shortest/any path; identify safe corridors.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Right to column 9 (open corridor), then down to goal (no walls).\n\n- Start: row 1 col 6\n- R: row 1 col 7 (empty)\n- R: row 1 col 8 (empty)\n- R: row 1 col 9 (empty, navigated to open right column)\n- D: row 2 col 9 (empty)\n- D: row 3 col 9 (empty, avoids row 3 col 4 wall indirectly)\n- D: row 4 col 9 (empty)\n- D: row 5 col 9 (empty, avoids row 5 col 1)\n- D: row 6 col 9 (empty, avoids row 6 col 4)\n- D: row 7 col 9 (empty, avoids row 7 col 2)\n- D: row 8 col 9 (empty, avoids row 8 col 1/5)\n- D: row 9 col 9 (empty)\n- D: row 10 col 9 (goal, navigated around all left walls by staying right)\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace:\n1.

Patterns/constraints: Upper section (rows 1-4) is completely open (no walls). Row 5 has a single wall at col 1, but goal at col 4 is accessible. Lower section (rows 6+) forms a maze-like structure with blockages, creating potential dead ends (e.g., row 6 col 4 blocked, row 12 cols 4-5 blocked). Player and goal are in the same column (col 4), only 3 rows apart, with no walls in col 4 between rows 2-5. Moves must stay within bounds (rows 1-12, cols 1-5) and avoid # cells. Up decreases row number, down increases it, left decreases col, right increases col.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Shortest path is straight down column 4 (3 downs), as rows 3-5 col 4 are open. Multiple paths exist due to open upper grid: e.g., go left to col 3 or right to col 5, down, then back right/left. Paths blocked: Cannot enter row 5 col 1 (wall). From row 5 col 4, cannot go down to row 6 col 4 (wall). Dead ends/traps: Venturing below row 5 risks entrapment—e.g., row 6 cols 1,2,4,5 blocked, forcing narrow path through row 6 col 3; row 7 col 3 blocked; row 12 cols 4-5 inaccessible. Going left into row 5 col 1 hits wall immediately. General direction: Primarily down (net +3 rows), stay near col 4. Approaches that fail: (1) Going up first (to row 1) wastes moves, requires extra downs—no advantage. (2) Circling in upper open area loops indefinitely. (3) Going down past goal into lower maze (e.g., DDDD from start hits row 6 col 4 wall). (4) Extreme left/right hugging walls col 1/5 risks row 5 col 1 or lower traps. Generic strategies: Model as graph (cells as nodes, adjacent empties as edges); mentally BFS/DFS for shortest path, prioritizing direct vector to goal. Visualize net displacement (here +3 row, 0 col). Prune by identifying open corridors (col 4 rows 2-5). Avoid greedily following walls (maze trap). Test invariants: column parity, reachable components. Transferable: Break into subgoals (e.g., reach row 5 any col, then to col 4); backtrack from dead ends; simulate opponent (walls as blockers).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Direct down column 4 (shortest, no risks). \n- Start: row 2, col 4. Move D → row 3, col 4 (open -, navigates nothing, stays in open corridor).\n- Now: row 3, col 4. Move D → row 4, col 4 (open -, continues straight to goal row).\n- Now: row 4, col 4.

Patterns/constraints: Completely open grid with no obstacles, allowing free movement in four directions. Key constraints are grid boundaries (cannot go above row 1, below row 11, left of column 1, or right of column 5). Net displacement needed: +6 rows (down), +1 column (right).\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Innumerable paths exist due to zero obstacles; any sequence with exactly 6 D (down) and 1 R (right), in any order, will reach the goal without excess moves, as long as intermediate positions stay in bounds. Minimum path length: 7 moves. Multiple possible paths: e.g., all downs first then right (DDDDDDR); right first then downs (RDDDDDD); interleaved like DDRDDDD, etc. No paths are blocked since no walls. Dead ends/traps: None, as the grid is fully traversable; however, straying to edges risks out-of-bounds if not careful (e.g., excessive L from col 1 or R from col 5), but recoverable since open. General direction: Primarily down (6 steps) with a minor right adjustment (1 step); stay near column 2-3 to minimize boundary risks. Approaches that would fail: (1) Paths with U (up) moves: Unnecessary and risky, as they move away from goal and could hit row 1 boundary immediately (e.g., U from start goes out of bounds). (2) Paths with extra L then compensating R: Longer than minimal (e.g., L R DDDDDD = 8 moves), inefficient but valid. (3) Excessive side movement: 3 R from col 2 hits col 5 boundary (invalid move), forcing backtracking. (4) Going too far down (beyond row 11): Possible with >10 D, but irrelevant for minimal paths. (5) Ignoring bounds: Any move attempting row 0/12 or col 0/6 is invalid. Optimal strategy: Minimal moves, prefer staying central (cols 2-3) to avoid edges; choose a simple sequence like downs first (to row 7 col 2) then right for clarity.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: DDDDDDR (downs first to align row, then right; keeps path straight and central, minimal length, low boundary risk).\n- Start: row 1, col 2\n- Move 1: D → row 2, col 2 (open space, progressing toward goal row)\n- Move 2: D → row 3, col 2 (open, continuing down column 2)\n- Move 3: D → row 4, col 2 (open, halfway to goal row)\n- Move 4: D → row 5, col 2 (open, navigating central path)\n- Move 5: D → row 6, col 2 (open, one row from goal)\n- Move 6: D → row 7, col 2 (open, now same row as goal, offset by 1 column left)\n- Move 7: R → row 7, col 3 (open, reaches goal; avoids any hypothetical edge issues by doing lateral last)\n\nAlternate paths explored: RDDDDDD (right first to col 3 row 1, then down col 3: equally valid, stays right-central). DDDDRDD (interleaved: valid but no advantage). Invalid alternates: LDDDDDDR (goes to col 1, valid but 8 moves longer inefficiently); U anything (fails bounds immediately); RRRRRR (stays row 1, hits col 5 bound after 3R, cannot proceed right).\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace from start (1,2):\n1.

Early right to column 5 blocked by row 2 column 5 #. Down column 5 from row 3/4 hits row 5 column 5 #, forcing left detour back to column 4.\n\n- Dead ends/traps to avoid: Column 2 areas (e.g., row 2 column 2 down blocked by row 3 column 2 #; similar in rows 3-6). Bottom row 8 column 3 # traps if overshoot left. Looping up to row 1 wastes moves without progress.\n\n- General direction: Prioritize down via open corridors (column 3 early, column 4 late); insert rights after bypassing row 5 column 3 #.\n\n- Failed approaches: (1) Greedy down (DDDD...): Hits row 5 column 3 # immediately after row 4. (2) Greedy right (RR): Blocked at row 2 column 5 #. (3) Left first (LL): Enters narrow left area with multiple dead ends (e.g., row 3-6 column 2 walls trap downward progress, requiring backtrack). (4) Upward exploration: Increases distance, no shortcuts. These fail due to ignoring local obstacles; success requires lookahead for blockages.\n\nGeneric strategies (extensible): Mentally map grid as graph, identify 'corridors' (open columns/rows). Use mental BFS: explore adjacent moves, prune dead ends (no-goal paths). Compute adjusted Manhattan accounting for walls. Backtrack from obstacles. Prioritize primary direction (down) while scouting perpendicular (right). Test alternates mentally to confirm optimality.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Down column 3 to row 4 (bypassing early walls), right to column 4 (open corridor), down to row 7 column 4, right to goal. This avoids all walls efficiently in 7 moves.\n\n- Start: row 2, column 3\n- Move D -> New: row 3, column 3 (open -; navigates right of row 3 column 2 # wall)\n- Move D -> New: row 4, column 3 (open -; stays ahead of row 5 column 3 #)\n- Move R -> New: row 4, column 4 (open -; shifts to clear column 4 corridor)\n- Move D -> New: row 5, column 4 (open -; avoids row 5 column 3 # and column 5 #)\n- Move D -> New: row 6, column 4 (open -; avoids row 6 column 2 #)\n- Move D -> New: row 7, column 4 (open -)\n- Move R -> New: row 7, column 5 (G; final)\n\nAlternate considered: After row 6 column 4, R to row 6 column 5 (open), D to goal (also works, same length; confirms redundancy in column 4/5 lower area).\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace with positions after each move (rows 1-8, cols 1-5 bounds checked; no # hit):\n- Start: (2,3)\n- 1.

Player starts at position (8,4). Goal is at (7,1). Wall locations: (1,2), (2,1), (3,4), (4,4), (7,4), (8,2). All other cells are passable empty spaces (-), with G being the passable goal.\n\nKey patterns and constraints: The grid is mostly open in the lower half, but walls create blockages. Notably, a wall directly above the start at (7,4) blocks upward movement from (8,4). Another wall at (8,2) blocks leftward access along row 8 beyond column 3. Upper walls at (2,1), (1,2), (3,4), (4,4) form partial barriers on the left and middle-right, but since the goal is in row 7, column 1, we likely don't need to navigate far up. The goal is immediately above and to the left, requiring net movement: up 1 row, left 3 columns. Bounds must be respected: cannot go above row 1, below row 8, left of col 1, or right of col 5. Walls are impassable.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: The shortest path requires 4 moves (1 up, 3 left), as the Manhattan distance is 4, and no major detours are forced nearby. General direction: primarily left and slightly up. Multiple paths exist, but the direct one is optimal.\n\n- Paths blocked: Direct up from (8,4) hits wall at (7,4). Moving left twice from (8,4) to (8,2) hits wall at (8,2). From the right side (e.g., (8,5) then up to (7,5)), leftward progress is blocked by (7,4)# , forcing a long detour up through rows 6-1 and around upper walls to loop back left, which is inefficient (10+ moves).\n\n- Dead ends/traps to avoid: Going right to column 5 leads to a semi-dead end; from (7,5), cannot go left due to (7,4)#, up to (6,5) is open but commits to navigating the upper maze-like walls (e.g., avoiding (3,4),(4,4)), risking longer paths or backtracking. Staying in row 8 leftward beyond col 3 is impossible due to (8,2)#. No down moves possible from row 8.\n\n- Why certain approaches fail: Greedy 'up first' fails due to (7,4)#. 'Left maximal first' (LL) fails at (8,2)#. BFS-like exploration prioritizes adjacent opens: from start, L and R open, U blocked, D out-of-bounds; L leads quickly to goal via up-left, R leads to detour. Generic strategy: Mentally perform BFS or DFS with backtracking on small grids; identify local obstacles and bypass them minimally (here, bypass (7,4)# by shifting left 1 column first). Consider chokepoints like row 7 col 4 wall splitting left/right access. Extensible to other domains: Decompose into subgoals (e.g., 'reach row 7 left side'), enumerate first-move consequences, prune dead ends by checking connectivity to goal.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: LULL (left to bypass wall above start, up to row 7, then left twice to goal). This is shortest and avoids all traps.\n\n- Start: (8,4)\n  Move L → New position: (8,3) [empty; navigates around future up-block at (7,4) by positioning for clear up move]\n- Current: (8,3)\n  Move U → New position: (7,3) [empty; enters row 7, now same row as goal]\n- Current: (7,3)\n  Move L → New position: (7,2) [empty; moves toward goal column]\n- Current: (7,2)\n  Move L → New position: (7,1) [goal; reaches destination]\n\nAlternate paths explored: RUL LLL... (right-up-left detour) longer (e.g., (8,4)R(8,5)U(7,5)L blocked, so U(6,5)L(6,4)U(5,4)L(5,3)... eventually left but 12+ moves, hits potential upper walls).

The grid is mostly open empty cells (-), with no other obstacles. Key constraints: walls are impassable; moves must stay within bounds (rows 1-10, cols 1-12). Patterns: vast open space allows flexible paths; the wall at (4,2) slightly blocks the upper-left area of row 4 but does not affect access to the goal at (4,6); the lower wall at (8,7) is distant and irrelevant for reaching the nearby goal. Net displacement needed: up 1 row (decrease row by 1), left 5 columns (decrease column by 5). Shortest path length: 6 moves.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist due to open grid: primary options include moving left 5 then up 1 (along row 5 then to row 4), or up 1 then left 5 (to row 4 then along it), or interleaving (e.g., left 2, up 1, left 3). All shortest paths work since row 5 (cols 6-11) and row 4 (cols 6-11) are fully open—no walls in relevant areas. Blocked paths: any move into (4,2) or (8,7) fails; going left beyond col 1 or right beyond col 12 hits bounds. Dead ends/traps: none significant, as open space allows backtracking, but unnecessary here; e.g., wandering down to row 8 risks hitting (8,7) if moving left-right there, but irrelevant. General direction: primarily left (to col 6) with one up (to row 4)—avoid right/down to prevent lengthening path or bounds issues. Failing approaches: going right first (increases col, away from goal, hits col 12 bound after 1R); going down first (to row 6+, away from goal row 4); looping unnecessarily (e.g., UD wastes moves). BFS/DFS mentally: prioritize minimal moves, check adjacent cells. Extensible strategy: compute Manhattan distance (here 6), identify obstacles via scan, prefer boundary-aligned paths to minimize turns/dead ends; in other domains (e.g., mazes, graphs), use A* heuristic (distance to goal) to guide, avoid explored dead ends.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: left along row 5 to column 6 (avoids early row change, stays in fully open row), then up to goal—simple, no obstacles.

Player starts at position (row 3, column 5), marked by '@'. Goal is at (row 1, column 4), marked by 'G'. Walls ('#') are impassable at positions: (row 2, column 5), (row 4, column 4), and (row 5, column 1). All other cells are empty ('-') and traversable. Key constraints include staying within bounds (rows 1-5, columns 1-5), avoiding walls entirely, and only moving U (up: decrease row by 1), D (down: increase row by 1), L (left: decrease column by 1), or R (right: increase column by 1). Patterns: The grid is mostly open, but the wall at (2,5) directly blocks upward movement from the start, forcing a detour leftward. The wall at (4,4) blocks some lower-right paths, and (5,1) minimally obstructs the bottom-left corner. No diagonal moves or jumping allowed, making it a strict grid pathfinding problem.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations prioritize shortest or reliable paths while avoiding dead ends. General direction needed: primarily up (to reduce row from 3 to 1) and slightly left (from column 5 to 4), but obstacles require maneuvering. Multiple paths exist, such as going left then up, or detouring down and around, but shorter paths are preferable for efficiency.\n\n- Paths blocked: Direct up from start hits wall at (2,5), so immediate 'U' fails. From lower positions, left into (4,4) wall is blocked. Bottom row has partial blockage at (5,1), but escapable.\n- Dead ends/traps: Going down to row 4/5 then left risks nearing (4,4) wall without easy up access, potentially looping (e.g., from (4,5) can't left to #, must backtrack). Bottom-left corner around (5,1) is navigable but inefficient and risks unnecessary detours.\n- Alternate paths: One option is L to (3,4), U to (2,4), U to (1,4) -- direct and short. Longer: L L to (3,3), U U to (1,3), R to (1,4). Or down D to (4,5), L? No (4,4)# blocks, so D again to (5,5), L L L to (5,2), U U U L R etc. -- much longer, higher risk of error. Going right from start out of bounds (invalid).\n- Approaches that fail and why: Greedy 'up-up' ignores wall, hits # at (2,5). Pure left then up works but check lengths. Flood-fill mental BFS: explore neighbors level-by-level mentally to find viable paths. Backtracking helps identify dead ends early. Extensible strategy: Always check move validity (bounds + no #) before committing; prioritize moves toward goal (Manhattan distance: |Δrow| + |Δcol|); avoid one-way traps by noting connectivity.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Shortest viable path avoiding obstacles -- left to bypass upper wall, then straight up to goal.\n- Start at (3,5).\n- Move L: To (3,4) -- empty '-', navigates around the impending wall at (2,5) by shifting left.\n- Move U: To (2,4) -- empty '-', now above the start row, clear path upward.\n- Move U: To (1,4) -- goal 'G', directly reaches destination, no further obstacles.\n\nThis path is 3 moves, minimal detours. Alternates like extra lefts add steps unnecessarily.\n\n# Verification\n\nTrace entire solution step-by-step:\n1. Start: (3,5) -- valid.\n2. After L: (3,4) -- row 3 col 4 is '-', in bounds (1-5), no wall.\n3. After U: (2,4) -- row 2 col 4 is '-', in bounds, no wall.\n4. After U: (1,4) -- row 1 col 4 is 'G', in bounds, no wall hit (goal is traversable endpoint).\n\nFull path stays within 1-5 rows/cols, hits no '#', ends exactly at goal. No errors found; alternates verified longer but valid (e.g., L L U U R also works but 5 moves). This teaches systematic checking: simulate each move, confirm preconditions, ensures robustness transferable to larger grids or with more obstacles via search algorithms like DFS/BFS with backtracking.</think>\n\n{\"solution\": \"LUU\"}"}],"llmPathLength":3}

Examples:\n- Up first to row 9, column 7, then left 6 times along row 9 to column 1 (hits goal).\n- Left 6 times along row 10 to column 1, then up to row 9, column 1.\n- Zigzag paths (e.g., left 3, up, left 3) also work but longer.\n\nBlocked paths: none directly block goal access, but if deviating unnecessarily upward past row 9 toward row 4 at column 6, could hit wall (e.g., going up multiple times to row 4, column 6). Dead ends/traps: none, as grid is open—no enclosed areas or one-way paths. Can always backtrack if needed. General direction: primarily left (6 steps net), minor up (1 step net). Avoid right/down excess to minimize moves.\n\nApproaches that would NOT work and why:\n- Going right first (e.g., R): moves away from goal, hits right bound (col 9) quickly, requires extra lefts later—increases path length unnecessarily.\n- Going down first: impossible, already at bottom (row 10), D would go out of bounds.\n- Going up excessively (e.g., 6 ups to row 4, then left): risks hitting wall at (4,6) if not adjusting column; inefficient as goal is only 1 row up.\n- Staying on row 10 and going right/up mix: prolongs path, no benefit.\nBFS-style thinking (extensible): explore neighbors level-by-level from start; shortest path avoids wall naturally. Heuristics like Manhattan distance (7) guide toward goal.\n\nChosen strategy: left 6 along row 10 (safe bottom path), then up 1. Simple, shortest, avoids any upper grid risk. Transferable: prioritize direct net displacement, check bounds/obstacles per move, prefer boundary paths in open grids.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nStart: row 10, col 7.\n- Move L: to row 10, col 6 (empty).\n- Move L: to row 10, col 5 (empty).\n- Move L: to row 10, col 4 (empty).\n- Move L: to row 10, col 3 (empty).\n- Move L: to row 10, col 2 (empty).\n- Move L: to row 10, col 1 (empty, navigates left edge).\n- Move U: to row 9, col 1 (goal G, no obstacle).\n\nThis hugs the bottom/left boundaries, zero risk of wall.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace:\n1.

Column 1 and 2 are completely open from row 2 downward to row 10 (no walls). Upper row 1 has a wall at col 1. Right side has isolated walls. No diagonal moves; only orthogonal U/D/L/R. Must stay within bounds (rows 1-12, cols 1-8); out-of-bounds moves invalid. Path must avoid all # cells. General displacement needed: +7 rows down, +2 columns right.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist due to open corridors in columns 1-2 and 4-8 in most rows. Safest path hugs left side (cols 1-2), which is wall-free down to row 10, allowing direct descent then short right to goal.\n\nBlocked paths: Direct descent in col 3 hits walls at row 5 col 3 and row 7 col 3.

Lower right row 9 col 7 # irrelevant for goal.\n\nDead ends/traps: Early right to col 3 (rows 2-4) leads to row 5 col 3 #, forcing backtrack (trap for greedy right-then-down). Bottom col 3 walls (rows 11-12) block if overshoot down in col 3, but avoidable.

Prioritize obstacle-free columns for major displacement (down here). Explore branches mentally: simulate short detours. Use net displacement to bound search. Avoid greedy local optima (e.g., nearest to goal col but blocked).

Player '@' and goal 'G' positions are also passable.\n\nPatterns/constraints: The grid is mostly open, especially row 3 which is completely clear from column 1 to 7 (no walls). Walls in row 2 partially block upward movement. Lower walls in rows 6-7 are isolated and do not block access to the goal but could create minor navigation hurdles if detouring south. Boundaries (row 1-11, col 1-7) must not be violated. Direct horizontal path on row 3 is unobstructed. Generic strategy insight: Always map positions relative to goal and scan for local obstacles; open rows/columns enable straight-line paths, extensible to maze-solving by prioritizing adjacency checks.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations:\n- Multiple possible paths: Yes, many due to open grid. Shortest: direct right on row 3 (4 moves). Longer alternatives: go down to row 4/5, right, up (e.g., DRRRU, 5 moves); loop around walls below; or north around row 2 walls (much longer).\n- Paths blocked and why: Direct up from start (row 2, col 2) is open, but rightward on row 2 hits ## at col 3-4, forcing detour left/up/down. Lower path to row 7 col 6 blocked by # there, but irrelevant for goal at row 3 col 6. No blocks on row 3 rightward.\n- Dead ends/traps to avoid: No true dead ends (grid open), but potential traps include: entering row 2 col 3-4 (impassable, immediate fail); row 7 col 6 (can't pass, backtrack needed); going left to col 1 or down to row 11 (away from goal, wastes moves). Generic: Identify 'cul-de-sacs' where walls protrude into open space, forcing backtracking—scan for 3-sided enclosures.\n- General direction needed: Primarily right (net +4 columns), same row (net 0 vertical). Minimal vertical deviation optimal.\n- Why certain approaches would fail:\n  - Going up then right: U to (2,2), R attempts (2,3)# invalid—hits wall immediately.\n  - Going left first: L to (3,1), then must R back plus more, inefficient.\n  - Going far down then up: Hits no walls but longer (e.g., DDDDD RRRR UUUUU =14 moves vs 4); risks boundary or unnecessary wall dodges. \n  - Ignoring bounds: RRRRR from start goes to col7 (ok) but overshoots goal.\nGeneric extensible strategies: Prioritize shortest path by Manhattan distance (here |6-2|+|3-3|=4), validate locally before committing; explore branches mentally (direct > detour); eliminate failing prefixes early (e.g., UR invalid); applicable to any grid pathfinding—combine with BFS thinking for optimality.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Direct right on row 3 (RRRR)—shortest, no obstacles, no detours needed.\n- Move 1: Current position (3,2), Direction R, New position (3,3).

Column 1 is completely open from row 4 to row 2 (no walls), allowing direct vertical movement. Walls in row 4 (cols 4,6) block horizontal progress rightward from start without detours. Top-right walls (row 1 col 5, row 2 cols 9-10) restrict access to far right upper areas but do not affect left-side paths. Bounds prevent moving outside rows 1-4 or cols 1-10. Pathfinding must avoid walls and stay in bounds; shortest paths prioritize minimal moves, but any valid path reaches goal.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Multiple paths exist due to open spaces, but the simplest and shortest is direct upward movement in column 1 (2 ups). Alternate paths include moving right into row 4 cols 2-3, then up, then left, or looping around walls (e.g., right to col 3, up to row 3, right/up maneuvers). Paths blocked: Cannot pass row 4 col 4 or col 6 walls directly—e.g., RRR from start hits col 4 #; RR U R hits col 6 # if not careful. Dead ends/traps: Venturing right in row 4 beyond col 3 leads to wall at col 4, requiring backtrack (L); far right in row 2 blocked by ## at cols 9-10, and row 1 col 5 # creates a partial barrier but bypassable left. General direction: Primarily up (net -2 rows), staying in low columns (left side) to avoid row 4 walls; no net left/right needed (same col 1). Approaches that fail: Pure rightward (RRR hits # at (4,4)); immediate down (out of bounds); looping unnecessarily right/up then struggling with top walls (e.g., going to col 10 row 2 blocked).

No other obstacles, so open space allows many paths, but the wall creates a minor blockage on the left edge at row 8.\n\nPatterns: The grid is almost entirely open except for one wall near the bottom-left, suggesting paths should avoid approaching the goal via (9,1) -> (8,1).

Over-up in col 3 hits wall, forcing backtrack. No true traps (no enclosed areas).\n- General direction: primarily up (net -4 rows), same column, no net left/right needed.\n- Why certain approaches fail:\n  - Straight down: moves away (increases row), no path to goal without U-turn (inefficient).\n  - Left/right first without ups: stays at row 8, delays progress.\n  - Up then left/right at row 4: reaches goal already, unnecessary.\n  - BFS/manhattan shortest path: |8-4| + |3-3| = 4 ups; any deviation lengthens path.\n  - Greedy up always: works here but would fail if wall were between rows 4-8.\n\nOptimal strategy: direct column-aligned ascent (UUUU), as no intervening obstacles.

Player starts at position (row 2, column 6). Goal is at (row 8, column 1). Walls (#) are impassable at the following positions: (2,7), (2,8), (3,8), (8,4). All other cells are empty (-), and the goal (G) is reachable. Key patterns: The grid is mostly open space, with walls clustered in the top-right area near the start (blocking rightward movement) and a single wall at (8,4) on the goal row, which could trap paths approaching the goal row from the right without adjustment. Constraints: Moves must stay within 1-9 bounds; no diagonal moves; cannot pass through or land on #. No other obstacles like one-way paths or dynamic elements.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist due to the open grid, but careful navigation avoids the few walls. General direction needed: primarily down (increase row by 6) and left (decrease column by 5). A direct 'left then down' path hugs the left edge, avoiding all walls entirely. Alternative paths include 'down then left,' but this risks dead ends: reaching row 8 at column 6, then moving left hits the # at (8,4), blocking straight left to column 1—forcing a detour like left to column 5, up to row 7, left past column 4, down again (longer and error-prone). Paths going right from start fail immediately (R hits # at (2,7)). Going up first (to row 1) is possible but inefficient, looping back adds unnecessary steps without benefit. Dead ends/traps: Top-right corner is walled off (can't escape rightward easily due to (2,7),(2,8),(3,8)); goal row right side traps naive right-to-left sweeps due to (8,4). BFS/DFS mentally: Shortest paths ~11 moves (5L+6D); prefer boundary-hugging to minimize wall interactions. Approaches that fail: Rightward exploration (immediate wall); down-to-goal-row then left (hits # at (8,4)); ignoring bounds (e.g., left from col1 fails). Successful strategy: Clear left column (column 1) from row 2-8 is completely open—no walls—making 'LLLLLDDDDDD' optimal and safe.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Move left along row 2 to column 1 (open path: columns 5-1 all empty), then down column 1 to row 8 (fully open). \n- Start: (2,6)\n- L → (2,5) [empty]\n- L → (2,4) [empty]\n- L → (2,3) [empty]\n- L → (2,2) [empty]\n- L → (2,1) [empty; navigated around top-right walls by staying left]\n- D → (3,1) [empty]\n- D → (4,1) [empty]\n- D → (5,1) [empty]\n- D → (6,1) [empty]\n- D → (7,1) [empty]\n- D → (8,1) [goal; avoided goal-row wall by approaching from above in col1]\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace:\n1.

Key patterns: Walls are sparse and isolated, primarily on the left side (rows 9-10) and upper areas (row 1 col 5, row 5 col 11). No walls on row 11 between columns 1-7 or anywhere on row 11. Start and goal are on the same row, only 6 columns apart. Constraints: Cannot pass through #, must stay within rows 1-11 and columns 1-11. No diagonal moves; only U/D/L/R. Direct horizontal path on row 11 is completely open.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Shortest path is direct right (6 steps) along row 11, as there are no walls blocking columns 1 through 7 on row 11.

Long (20+ moves), high collision risk.\n- Left then loop around: Impossible, left is out of bounds; no wrap-around.\n- Up-right zigzag ignoring walls: Fails at row 10 col 3 # or row 9 col 1 #, leading to dead ends requiring backtracking (inefficient).\n- Staying on row 11 but left first: Can't, out of bounds.\n\nGeneric strategies: Always check direct path first (Manhattan distance: 6 right). Mentally map obstacles between start/goal. Prioritize shortest unobstructed path. If blocked, consider minimal detours (e.g., BFS mental simulation: explore neighbors level-by-level). Visualize grid quadrants: bottom row open, upper-left congested. Avoid 'greedy' up-moves without goal progress. Test alternates by simulating 2-3 steps ahead to spot dead ends early.

Row 10 column 2 and row 12 column 3 create minor traps in bottom-left.\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid: Venturing down to rows 9-12 leftward hits walls (e.g., row 10 col 2, row 12 col 3), forcing backtrack.

Player starts at row 5, column 2 (@). Goal is at row 4, column 4 (G). Wall locations (#): (1,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,1), (6,3), (6,4). Empty cells (-): all others except start and goal.\n\nPatterns and constraints: Walls form a cluster in the bottom-right (rows 5-6, cols 3-4), blocking direct right movement from start. A single wall at top-center (1,2). Most of the grid is open, especially rows 1-4 and row 7. Goal is immediately above and to the right of start, but direct right path blocked. Moves must stay within bounds (rows 1-7, cols 1-4); up decreases row number, down increases it; impassable walls force detours. No diagonal moves.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Shortest path requires moving up (to bypass row 5 walls) then right twice. General direction: primarily up 1, right 2. Multiple paths exist (e.g., go left first around walls, or down and loop around bottom), but many are longer.\n\nBlocked paths: Direct right from start (5,2) -> (5,3) hits wall. Down-right from start leads to row 6 walls (e.g., (6,3),(6,4) #). Up-right ideal, as row 4 is fully open except goal.\n\nDead ends/traps: Bottom area (rows 6-7) is semi-trapped; from (6,2), can't go right (#), left (# at 6,1), down leads to row 7 dead-end for goal-reaching without long loop up-left. Top wall (1,2) irrelevant here but could trap if over-navigating up. Going left from start to (5,1) then up works but adds moves.\n\nApproaches that fail: Greedy right-first hits wall immediately. Downward exploration away from goal (row increases) inefficient, risks wall clusters. Over-right in bounds but blocked. Successful strategy: Prioritize vertical clearance to open row 4, then horizontal to goal. Generic extensible strategies: 1) Map obstacles relative to vector from start to goal (here up-right blocked horizontally). 2) Mentally BFS: explore neighbors level-by-level, prune walls/out-of-bounds. 3) Identify 'chokepoints' (row 5 cols 3-4 walls). 4) Avoid opposite-direction moves unless looping necessary. 5) Verify paths by reverse-tracing from goal. These transfer to mazes, graphs, etc.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: URR (shortest, direct after bypass).\n- Current: (5,2). Move U -> New: (4,2) [empty; navigates around row 5 right walls by going up to open row 4].\n- Current: (4,2). Move R -> New: (4,3) [empty; row 4 clear path to goal].\n- Current: (4,3). Move R -> New: (4,4) [goal; completes horizontal traversal].\n\nAlternate explored: LURRR [left to (5,1), up (4,1), right thrice] works but 5 moves vs 3; teaches detour cost. Down-loop (e.g., D L D R UUU R) much longer, hits near-traps at row6 walls.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace:\n1. Start: (5,2)\n2. U: (4,2) [row 4-1=3?

Column 3 has no walls from row 1 to row 5, allowing unobstructed downward movement. Walls in column 2 (rows 3-4) block leftward paths into the middle rows but do not affect column 3. The grid has open space above (row 1), below (rows 6-7), and sides (columns 1 and 4), but the shortest path stays vertical.

Detours like going left to column 2 then down fail because walls block column 2 at rows 3-4. Right to column 4 then down then left works but is longer (e.g., R D D D L = 5 moves). Left to column 1 then down then right also works but longer (L D D D R = 5 moves). Up is impossible (already at top). Down then loop around bottom also possible but inefficient.\n- Blocked paths: Any path entering column 2 from row 2 downward hits walls at (3,2) or (4,2). For example, from start L D tries column 2 row 2 (empty), but next D hits wall at row 3 col 2.\n- Dead ends/traps: No true dead ends since bottom rows 6-7 and sides are open, but walls create a 'fence' in column 2 rows 3-4, trapping if you go left too early without planning return. Going right or left early adds moves unnecessarily.\n- General direction: Primarily down (net +4 rows), no net left/right needed since same column.\n- Failed approaches: \n  - Going left into walls (e.g., D L D): After first D to (2,3), L to (2,2) empty, D to (3,2) wall (impassable).\n  - Over-right then down: Possible but wasteful (extra 2 moves to return left).\n  - Going down past goal then up: Hits goal early or wastes moves.\n  - Horizontal loops: Unnecessary since vertical is open.\nBFS/DFS mentally: Shortest path is direct down; walls don't force detour.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Direct down (DDDD) - exploits open column 3, avoids walls entirely.\n- Start: row 1, col 3.\n  Move D → row 2, col 3 (empty, navigates straight down, no obstacles).\n- Current: row 2, col 3.\n  Move D → row 3, col 3 (empty, passes beside wall at row 3 col 2).\n- Current: row 3, col 3.\n  Move D → row 4, col 3 (empty, passes beside wall at row 4 col 2).\n- Current: row 4, col 3.\n  Move D → row 5, col 3 (G, reaches goal, no further obstacles).\n\nAlternate explored (for learning): If direct blocked (hypothetical), go R D D D L: Start (1,3) R→(1,4), D→(2,4), D→(3,4), D→(4,4), D→(5,4), L→(5,3) G.

Bottom row 6 accessible but longer (e.g., left/down to row 6 col 5, up to goal), split by # at cols 2-3/7. Traps/dead ends: row 4 left compartment (cols 1-3)—enter easily but trapped, no path to col 5 without backtracking/up. Row 4 right (col 9)—hard to reach, dead end. Generic strategies: Identify compartments/barriers (row 4 walls), find entry points to goal compartment (north via col 5), prioritize vertical progress with minimal lateral moves. Mentally BFS: explore neighbors level-by-level to find shortest/feasible path, prune blocked directions early. Avoid greedily following direct line if blocked (e.g., straight down from start hits no issue but left needed). Test hypotheticals: simulate failing paths (e.g., LLLDD—reaches row 4 col 3, stuck) to learn blockages. Extensible: in other domains (mazes, graphs), model as graph search, note chokepoints, compute min moves via distances.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: LDDD (left in row 2 to align with open col 5 vertical shaft, then down through open cells).

Dead-end test: e.g., LLLD → row2 col3, D→row3 col3, D→row4 col3 (-), then R→row4 col4 (# invalid)—confirms blockage, requires backtrack (not in solution).</think>\n\n{\"solution\": \"LDDD\"}"}],"llmPathLength":4}

Multiple viable paths exist, e.g., 'URR' (up first, then right twice) or 'RUR' (right, up, right). Both avoid walls.\n\nBlocked paths:\n- Cannot go right twice first ('RR'): From (2,5) R to (2,6) open, but next R to (2,7) hits wall at row 2 col 7.\n- Cannot reach goal via lower rows: Column 7 walls in rows 3-4 create a dead end; any path going down (D) first leads to longer detours or blocks (e.g., from row 3 col 7 impossible, must backtrack up).\n\nDead ends/traps: \n- Going left extensively (e.g., LLL) into left side wastes moves, hits wall at row 2 col 3 indirectly, no direct benefit.\n- Going down to row 4 then right hits col 7 wall, forcing backtrack (trap for greedy rightward push).\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily up and right. Prioritize reaching row 1 before column 7, as only row 1 col 7 is open on right edge.\n\nFailed approaches:\n- Greedy rightward: Fails due to row 2 col 7 wall.\n- Greedy upward only: From (1,5) need to go right, but if ignore and go left/up more, loops uselessly.\n- BFS/DFS mental simulation: Explore neighbors level-by-level to find shortest; here, both 3-move paths found early.\nGeneric strategy: Use net displacement calculation (Δrow=-1, Δcol=+2). Test permutations of required moves, validate against obstacles/bounds. Avoid overcommitment to one direction (e.g., don't RR without checking). Extensible: Applies to grid pathfinding (A*, BFS), where heuristics like Manhattan guide, obstacles require backtracking simulation.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: 'URR' (one of shortest; 'RUR' equivalent).\n- Current: (2,5).

Failing approaches: All-down first (goes away from goal, hits bottom bound); rightward moves (increases column distance); paths through (7,4) (impassable, e.g., LLLLD R fails at wall).

Manhattan distance is 3 units right, suggesting a direct path is possible unless blocked.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist, but the shortest and simplest is directly right along row 4 (RRR), as columns 2, 3, and 4 in row 4 are open ('-', 'G').\n\nBlocked paths:\n- Straight right is open, no blocks.\n- Going up to row 3: row 3, column 1 and 2 open, but column 3 is #, blocking direct right to goal column; would require detour right to column 4 (open), but then down, longer.\n- Going down to row 5: row 5 columns 1-3 open, but column 4 # blocks direct right.\n- Going left from start: out of bounds (column 0 invalid).\n\nDead ends/traps:\n- Row 3, column 3 # creates a barrier; entering row 3 left side leads to dead end unless detouring far right.\n- Row 5, column 4 # blocks downward access to goal row directly.\n- Lower areas (rows 6-8) have clustered walls (e.g., row 6 col 5/7, row 7 col 4), creating narrow passages prone to trapping if over-detoured.\n- Far right (column 9) has walls in rows 2 and scattered others, risky for loops.\n\nGeneral direction: primarily right 3 steps, same row; minimal up/down needed. BFS-like mental search prioritizes shortest paths, checking adjacent cells first.\n\nApproaches that fail:\n- Going left/up/left combinations: hits bounds immediately.\n- Down then right: hits row 5 col 4 #.\n- Up-right-up: blocked by row 3 col 3 #.\n- Circling bottom (down multiple, right, up): longer, risks row 6/7 walls, unnecessary since direct open. These fail due to ignoring open direct path or hitting impassable #/bounds.\n\nGeneric strategies: Visualize grid mentally or sketch; compute Manhattan distance for heuristic; explore breadth-first mentally (level by level from start); prune blocked directions early; identify 'chokepoints' (walls blocking lines); backtrack from dead ends; extensible to mazes/AI pathfinding by prioritizing low-cost moves.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Direct right along row 4 (RRR) - shortest, no obstacles.\n\n- Current position: row 4, col 1. Direction: R. New position: row 4, col 2 ('-'). Obstacles navigated: none, direct open cell.\n- Current position: row 4, col 2. Direction: R. New position: row 4, col 3 ('-'). Obstacles navigated: none.\n- Current position: row 4, col 3. Direction: R. New position: row 4, col 4 ('G'). Obstacles navigated: reached goal.\n\nAlternate explored mentally (not chosen): Up to row 3 col 1, right to row 3 col 2, up to row 2 col 2 (open), right/right/down etc., but longer (10+ moves), unnecessary.\n\n# Verification\n\nStart: row 4, col 1.\n1.

Player starts at row 10, column 1 (@---). Goal is at row 5, column 2 (-G--). There are no walls (#) anywhere in the grid; every cell is an empty '-' except the player start and goal positions. Key constraints: moves must stay within bounds (rows 1-10, columns 1-4); cannot pass through walls (none present). Patterns: the grid is completely open and traversable, forming a narrow vertical corridor with no obstacles, allowing free movement up/down/left/right within column limits. This simplifies pathfinding to a basic grid traversal without barriers, but bounds (especially left edge at column 1 and narrow 4-column width) must be respected to avoid invalid out-of-bounds moves.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: The minimal path requires exactly 5 'U' moves (to decrease row from 10 to 5) and 1 'R' move (to increase column from 1 to 2), for a total Manhattan distance of 6 steps. Multiple possible paths exist: any interleaving of these 5 U's and 1 R (e.g., all U then R, R then all U, or mixed like UURUUU). All such paths are valid due to no walls.\n\nNo paths are blocked, as there are no # obstacles. No dead ends or traps, since the grid is fully open—you can always backtrack or adjust. General direction needed: primarily 'U' (net 5 steps up) with a single 'R' to shift right. Staying in columns 1-4 is easy; starting at column 1 means 'L' would immediately go out of bounds (invalid), so avoid left moves entirely.\n\nApproaches that would NOT work and why:\n- Moving 'L' at start: out of bounds (column 0 invalid).\n- Moving 'D': increases row (goes down, away from goal at row 5), leading to inefficiency or needing compensatory extra 'U's later.\n- Excessive 'R's (e.g., RRR): hits column 4 bound, then further R invalid; would require 'L's to correct, lengthening path unnecessarily.\n- Random wandering (e.g., UDUD): oscillates without progress, inefficient but possible since open.\n- BFS/DFS mental search: ideal here—explore level-by-level from start, but since open, shortest paths are all 6-step combinations of 5U+1R. Prioritize column alignment early (e.g., R first) to streamline vertical travel in goal's column.\n\nGeneric strategies extensible to other domains: (1) Compute Manhattan distance for lower bound. (2) Identify net displacements (here, Δrow=-5, Δcol=+1). (3) Enumerate move sequences respecting invariants (bounds, no walls). (4) Prune invalid prefixes (e.g., starts with L). (5) In walled grids, use wall-following or A* heuristics; here, absent walls highlight pure bound-aware planning. Transfer: to mazes, add wall checks; to weighted graphs, Dijkstra; teaches modular reasoning (decompose into direction needs, validate sequences).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Move 'R' first to align column with goal, then 5 'U's straight up. This avoids any bound issues and keeps travel in column 2 after first move.\n\n- Current position: row 10, col 1\n- Direction moved: R\n- New position: row 10, col 2 (bounds ok, empty cell)\n- Obstacles navigated: none\n\n- Current: row 10, col 2\n- Direction: U\n- New: row 9, col 2 (bounds ok, empty)\n\n- Current: row 9, col 2\n- Direction: U\n- New: row 8, col 2\n\n- Current: row 8, col 2\n- Direction: U\n- New: row 7, col 2\n\n- Current: row 7, col 2\n- Direction: U\n- New: row 6, col 2\n\n- Current: row 6, col 2\n- Direction: U\n- New: row 5, col 2 (goal)\n\nAlternate paths explored: e.g., UUUUUR (up to row 5 col 1, then R)—also valid, navigates by reaching goal row first.

This wall blocks direct east-west traversal on row 4 from the left side to the goal. The lower-left walls create a minor barrier but do not affect paths from the starting area (right-center). No walls block the upper rows or right side. Player must move down 2 rows and right 2 columns net (Manhattan distance 4), but the (4,8) wall requires careful approach to the goal: cannot enter from left on row 4; must arrive via down from (3,9), right from (4,10), or potentially other detours.

General direction: primarily right (to col8), minor up (to row2); stay top-right quadrant. Failing approaches: (1) All left/down first - hits left wall or wanders far (e.g., LLLDD loops in open space but distance explodes >20 moves). (2) Down to row10 col8 - blocked, dead end (cannot U from there efficiently without backtrack). (3) Ignoring bounds - e.g., RRRRR from anywhere exceeds col8. Why fail: Deviate from goal vector, hit obstacles/bounds. Better: greedy towards goal (reduce max(|Δrow|,|Δcol|)), or BFS for shortest.

Moves are strictly U (row-1), D (row+1), L (col-1), R (col+1).\nPatterns: The grid is almost entirely open with no clustered walls or mazes—just a single wall in the bottom-left corner blocking (5,1). This creates a highly navigable space but requires avoiding bumping into the wall if moving left at the bottom row. Manhattan distance is |5-2| + |3-1| = 3 up + 2 left = 5 moves minimum, suggesting shortest paths exist without detours.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Primary directions needed are up (3 times net) and left (2 times net) to reach goal. No need for down or right in optimal paths, as they would require compensatory moves, lengthening the path.\nMultiple possible paths: Yes, many 5-move paths due to open space. Examples:\n- Up-first: U U L L U (goes up to row 3, left to col 1, up to goal).\n- Left-first: L U U U L (left at bottom, up to row 2 col 2, left to goal).\n- Mixed: U L U L U, etc.\nBlocked paths: Cannot go L from (5,2) to (5,1) due to wall—any path trying to access (5,1) fails. Going left twice immediately from start hits wall on second L.\nDead ends or traps: None significant—the wall is isolated and doesn't create loops or traps. However, going right (R) to col 4 and down (D) risks out-of-bounds (row 6 invalid), but recoverable by reversing. Over-relying on right creates inefficient detours.\nGeneral direction: Prioritize up and left; visualize as needing to climb 3 rows while shifting 2 columns left, avoiding bottom-left wall.\nApproaches that would NOT work and why:\n- Direct left-left-up-up-up: L to (5,2), L to (5,1)# invalid—hits wall.\n- Down moves: D from row 5 out-of-bounds.\n- Right-heavy paths: R R U U U L L requires 7+ moves, inefficient.\n- Ignoring bounds: U from row 1 or L from col 1 invalid.\nGeneric strategies extensible to other domains: Model grid as graph (cells=nodes, moves=edges), use BFS for shortest path in mazes. Here, mentally simulate paths, compute Manhattan as lower bound, enumerate short sequences. Prioritize obstacle avoidance by scanning adjacent cells before moving. Backtrack on dead ends. For larger grids, divide into subgoals (e.g., 'reach row 3 first'). Always verify bounds and walls per move. This transfers to robotics pathfinding, game AI, or planning under constraints.\nChosen path: UULLU—up-first clears vertical distance centrally, then left shift, final up. Efficient, avoids wall entirely.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nStart at (5,3).\n1. Move U: From (5,3) up to (4,3)—empty, no obstacle.\n2. Move U: From (4,3) up to (3,3)—empty, progressing vertically.\n3. Move L: From (3,3) left to (3,2)—empty, starts left shift safely above wall.\n4. Move L: From (3,2) left to (3,1)—empty, reaches left edge without issue.\n5. Move U: From (3,1) up to (2,1)—goal G, navigates final vertical step.\nThis avoids the wall (stays away from row 5 col 1), stays central initially to prevent early blocks.\nAlternate explored: Left-first (LUUUL): (5,3)-L>(5,2)-U>(4,2)-U>(3,2)-U>(2,2)-L>(2,1). Also works, but up-first chosen for central path stability.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace of UULLU:\n- Start: (5,3)\n- U: (4,3) — row4 col3 empty, in bounds.\n- U: (3,3) — row3 col3 empty, in bounds.\n- L: (3,2) — row3 col2 empty, in bounds.\n- L: (3,1) — row3 col1 empty, in bounds.\n- U: (2,1) — row2 col1 = G, in bounds.\nNo walls hit (path never touches (5,1)#).

Patterns/constraints: The grid is overwhelmingly open space with only two isolated walls in the bottom-right area, far from start and goal. No walls block direct access to the goal.

Patterns/constraints: Walls are sparse but strategically placed—upper walls (rows 1-3) block some northern paths, while row 8 walls create chokepoints for descending to row 9: left passage blocked at col 1, central-right blocked at col 6. This splits row 8 into open segments (cols 2-5 and 7-9). Net movement needed: down 2 rows, left 2 columns. Bounds must be respected (no row 0/11 or col 0/10). No diagonal moves; only U/D/L/R. Impassable walls force path planning around chokepoints.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist due to open spaces, but row 8 walls create traps/dead ends. Optimal general direction: down and left (net D2 L2), prioritizing row 7's fully open leftward path (cols 1-9 empty except player). Blocked paths: Cannot descend through row 8 col 6 (#)—e.g., from row 7 col 7 down to row 8 col 7, then left hits wall. Left-side row 8 col 1 (#) blocks far-left descent but irrelevant here. Dead ends/traps to avoid: Descending rightward (e.g., to row 8 cols 7-9) requires extra loops to reach col 5 (down to row 9, then left 2+); upper exploration (U) leads to irrelevant walls (row 3 col 7 #, row 1 col 6 #) and distances from goal. Failing approaches: (1) Direct down-left (e.g., D then L) fails—row 8 col 7 to col 6 is #. (2) L then D left of col 6 fails if too far left early (but not here). (3) Rightward detour (R to col 9, D, L to col 7 row 8, D to row 9 col 7, L L to col 5) works but longer (e.g., RRDDRRLL ~8 moves vs. 4). (4) Upward fails as goal is south, wastes moves, risks upper walls. Generic strategies: Visualize net displacement; identify barriers and bypasses (e.g., move laterally before vertical through chokepoints); prioritize shortest/obvious open lanes; mentally simulate 1-2 step fails to prune (e.g., BFS-like: explore neighbors, reject invalids); extensible to mazes/games—use 'wall-following' or 'gradient descent' toward goal, but check local blocks first.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: LLDD (left on row 7 to bypass row 8 col 6 #, then down through open row 8 col 5). Start: row 7 col 7. Move 1 L → row 7 col 6 (empty, navigates left on open row 7). Move 2 L → row 7 col 5 (empty, positions above open descent). Move 3 D → row 8 col 5 (empty, slips between row 8 walls at col 1/6). Move 4 D → row 9 col 5 (goal, clear vertical drop).\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace: Initial: row 7 col 7 (valid start).

Dead ends/traps: Minor—bottom-left around (9,3) could loop if going down/left unnecessarily; left column 1 open but leads to dead-endish top at (1,1). No true traps (all areas connected), but wasteful detours (e.g., down to row 10 adds 2x distance).

Walls are sparse and concentrated in the lower half (rows 5-7), creating potential obstacles only if detouring far down. No walls block the direct upper-right path to the goal. Key constraints: Cannot pass through # walls; must stay within row 1-10, column 1-7 bounds; up from row 1 or left from col 1/right from col 7/down from row 10 would be invalid.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple possible paths exist to the goal, including shortest paths of 3 moves: 'RRD' (right, right, down), 'RDR' (right, down, right), 'DRR' (down, right, right), and longer detours like going left/down then compensating.

Lower walls block certain lower routes: row 5 col 5 # obstructs rightward in row 5 middle-right; row 6 col 1 # blocks left entry to row 6; row 7 col 4 # creates a central barrier in row 7, potentially trapping if going deep south without planning north return.\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid: Going far down (e.g., to rows 8-10) is open but wasteful; approaching row 6 col 1 or row 7 col 4 risks getting stuck if trying narrow passages, though plenty of space around.

Extensible: In pathfinding, prioritize Manhattan distance (here |2-4|col + |6-1|row wait no |6-4|col=2 + |2-1|row=1 =3), check local obstacles first, explore branches only if blocked.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: 'RRD' (shortest, direct, no detours).\n- Current position: row 1, col 4\n- Direction moved: R (right)\n- New position: row 1, col 5 (empty '-')\n- Obstacles navigated: None; col 5 row 1 open.\n\n- Current position: row 1, col 5\n- Direction moved: R (right)\n- New position: row 1, col 6 (empty '-')\n- Obstacles navigated: None; col 6 row 1 open, col 7 unused.\n\n- Current position: row 1, col 6\n- Direction moved: D (down)\n- New position: row 2, col 6 (goal 'G')\n- Obstacles navigated: None; row 2 col 6 is goal, row 2 col 2 # far left irrelevant.\n\nAlternate 'DRR' verified mentally: (1,4) D>(2,4) empty, R>(2,5) empty, R>(2,6) G.

Player starts at (row 2, column 8). Goal is at (row 9, column 2). Walls (#) are impassable at positions: (1,3), (1,5), (1,6), (6,9), (8,2), (8,4), (9,9). The grid is mostly open space (-), with sparse obstacles. Key constraints: top row has clustered walls irrelevant to path; (6,9) blocks far right in mid-grid; row 8 has walls at col 2 and 4, creating a partial barrier in lower mid-grid; row 9 wall at col 9 splits right edge. Patterns: open vertical paths in columns 1-8 until row 8; row 9 is navigable left-to-right except col 9; goal blocked from directly above due to (8,2) wall. Manhattan distance: 7 down + 6 left = 13 moves minimum. No diagonal moves; stay in bounds 1-10.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist due to openness, but obstacles create traps. General direction: primarily down (net +7 rows) then left (net -6 columns). Safe strategy: descend first in column 8 (fully open from row 2-9), then traverse left along row 9 (open col 8 to col 2). This yields exact Manhattan 13 moves.\n\nBlocked paths: \n- Straight left to col 2 then down fails—row 8 col 2 wall blocks descent; from (7,2) cannot D to (8,2) #, stranding player above goal without side access.\n- Descending col 9 hits (6,9) # and (9,9) #.\n- Rightward first (e.g., R to col 10) requires backtracking, lengthening path unnecessarily.\n- Upward exploration hits top walls or bounds, diverging from goal.\n- Zigzagging row 8 risks (8,2)/(8,4) #; e.g., down col 8 to row 8 col 8, left to col 3 hits no wall but unnecessary vs. row 9 path.\n\nDead ends/traps: col 2 descent (row 8 block); right edge post-row 6 (9# blocks); looping top-left irrelevant. Failing approaches: greedy 'left then down' ignores local wall at (8,2); pure column-wise ignores row barriers. Better: visualize full grid, prioritize obstacle-free corridors (col 8 vertical, row 9 horizontal). Generic extensible strategy: compute Manhattan for lower bound; scan rows/cols for open lanes; test simple axis-aligned paths (down-then-left, left-then-down); reject if hitting #; fallback to detours (e.g., col 3-5 for row 8). Mirrors A* heuristics or BFS in pathfinding—prioritize low-cost directions, backtrack on blocks.

Similarly, excessive upward movement risks narrow passages blocked by (3,6)# or (2,5)#.\n- Dead ends/traps: Going left from start (to col 1-2) leads to open space but requires long detour rightward (extra 2+ moves left, then back). Upper rows (1-3) have traps like isolated segments behind (1,6)# and (3,6)#, e.g., entering row 3 col 7-12 is open but blocked from quick descent due to staggered walls. Row 4 right of col 6 is open until (4,10)#, but accessing it requires bypassing (4,5)# first.\n- General direction: Primarily down (to row 5) and right (to col 6), using the fully open row 5 columns 1-9 (except goal).\n- Failing approaches: Greedy rightward fails at (4,5)#. Going up first (e.g., U to (3,3)) requires looping around (3,6)# (e.g., right to col 7, down, left), adding 6+ moves. BFS mentally prioritizes short paths; DFS might explore dead ends like col 1.\nGeneric strategies: 1) Compute Manhattan distance for baseline. 2) Scan local obstacles between start/goal. 3) Simulate 1-2 move sequences to bypass immediate blocks. 4) Identify open corridors (here, row 5). 5) Explore alternatives: if primary path blocked, try permute order (down before right). Extensible to other domains: modular pathfinding (decompose into subgoals like 'reach row 5'), obstacle avoidance via lookahead, prune dead ends by boundary checks/backtracking limits.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: RDRR (prioritizes bypassing (4,5)# early by dropping to open row 5).\n- Current: (4,3).

Key constraints: cannot pass through # or go out of bounds (rows 1-8, columns 1-8).

Manhattan distance is |6-5| + |7-2| = 1 down + 5 right = 6 moves minimum. No other obstacles or patterns like mazes or clusters of walls.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist due to open grid: any sequence with net 5 rights and 1 down (in any order) will work, as long as no out-of-bounds or wall hits.

Dead ends/traps: none, as grid is open; however, going left from start hits left bound quickly (col 1, then invalid col 0), wasting moves. Going up extensively leads to top rows, where wall at (2,8) could trap if moving right to col 8 prematurely, but recoverable by moving left/down. General direction: primarily right (5 net), minor down (1 net); avoid left/up to minimize path length.\n\nApproaches that would NOT work and why:\n- All left/up: moves away from goal, hits bounds (e.g., LLL from start: (5,2)->(5,1)->invalid), or loops indefinitely without progress.\n- Ignoring bounds: RRRRRR from row 5 col 2 goes to col 8 (5,8), then further invalid.\n- Going to wall: UUU to (2,2), then RRRRRR to (2,8) hits #, dead end unless backtrack.\n- Extra moves without compensation: 4R 1D 1L requires extra R to correct, lengthening path.\n\nGeneric strategies: Use coordinate tracking for state (row,col). Compute net displacement needed. Mentally simulate BFS for shortest path in open spaces (prioritize goal direction). Check each move: new_pos = (row+dr, col+dc); if in bounds and not #, valid. Avoid cycles by tracking visited or preferring greedy toward goal.

E.g., path like UUUUU from start reaches row 4 col 3 open, but row 5 blocks further U.\n- In col 1, U from row 3 col 1 hits row 2 col 1 wall, trapping if overshooting goal northwards (but goal is row 8, so avoid northern travel).\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily up 1, left 2; stay south of row 5 wall and east of row 2 wall.\n\nFailed approaches:\n- Ignoring bounds: LLL from anywhere hits col 0 (invalid).\n- Through walls: U from row 6 col 3 to row 5 col 3 (blocked).\n- Overshooting: UUUUUULLL from start reaches north but trapped by walls, requires backtracking (inefficient).\n- Greedy left-first without checking: Works here but in complex grids could trap (e.g., if wall at row 9 col 1).\nGeneric strategies: Mentally map grid quadrants; prioritize shortest net displacement; enumerate short paths first (BFS-like: level 1 moves, level 2, etc.); mark walls as hard blocks and visualize 'around' routes; test alternates for dead-ends by simulating forward; prefer open areas near goal.\n\nChosen solution: LLU (direct left then up; simple, avoids col 3 entirely).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nStart: row 9, col 3.\n- Move 1: L (left). New position: row 9, col 2 (empty -). Navigates around nothing; stays in open row 9.\n- Move 2: L (left). New position: row 9, col 1 (empty -). Continues along open bottom row.\n- Move 3: U (up). New position: row 8, col 1 (G). Reaches goal; no obstacle.\n\nAlternate ULL also valid:\nStart: 9,3 -> U: 8,3 (-) -> L: 8,2 (-) -> L: 8,1 (G).\n\n# Verification\n\nTrace LLU:\n1.

Upper middle has walls at row 2 col 10 and row 3 cols 7/10, blocking direct rightward travel in early rows. Lower left blocked by row 4 col 1 #. Row 7 col 6 # is directly below goal but irrelevant since we stop at goal. Row 1, 5 all open. Bounds: moves must stay within rows 1-7, cols 1-12. Manhattan distance: +4 rows down, +4 columns right (minimum 8 moves). No diagonal moves; only U/D/L/R.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Need to move generally down and right. Multiple paths exist due to open space (e.g., down-then-right, right-then-down, or zigzag). Chosen path: straight down column 2 (open all the way), then right along row 6 to goal—simple, minimal backtracking, leverages fully open vertical and horizontal lanes.\n\nBlocked paths: Direct right along row 2 hits # at col 10 (cannot pass col 9 to 10). Down column 1 hits # at row 4 col 1 (after row 3 col 1). Around row 3 col 7 #: cannot cross it directly.\n\nDead ends/traps: Left side (col 1): open row 2-3 col 1, but row 4 col 1 # blocks further down—must move right before row 4 if in col 1.

Prioritize minimal deviation from Manhattan vector. Check forward visibility for blocks (e.g., scan column down from start). Explore alternates briefly to confirm viability. Identify traps by tracing paths to walls/edges without goal progress. Prefer greedy straight lines if open; fallback to contouring obstacles. In code/AI: BFS for optimality, A* with heuristic.

Row 3 walls form a 'trap' if aiming high-left: col 1 blocked, cols 3-4 blocked, funneling through col 2 or 5.

Multiple paths exist due to open space, e.g., go up/down then left then back, but all longer (Manhattan distance 5, extras add detours). Blocked paths: None directly block goal, but row 1 col 12 walls off top-right exit; row 4 col 10 blocks slight downward-right from start. Dead ends/traps: Minimal—going right from start leads to open space but away from goal (col 12 then wall at row1 col12 or open below); going down to row 4 col 8-11 then right hits wall at col10 if careless, creating minor trap requiring backtrack. General direction: Primarily left (net -5 columns), no row change needed. Failing approaches: (1) Rightward exploration wastes moves, leads to bounds/wall without progress; (2) Unnecessary up/down loops increase path length, risk bounds (e.g., up-up-up from row3 hits row1 wall if col12); (3) Down-right from start hits row4 col10 wall, dead end requiring reversal; (4) Overly complex zigzags ignore direct visibility of clear path, inefficient for pathfinding. Optimal: BFS/DFS shortest path favors direct left; greedy leftward succeeds here due to no obstacles.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Direct left along row 3, as it's unblocked shortest path.\n- Start: row 3, col 8\n- Move L: to row 3, col 7 (empty -, navigates nothing)\n- Move L: to row 3, col 6 (empty -, straight path)\n- Move L: to row 3, col 5 (empty -, continuing clear row)\n- Move L: to row 3, col 4 (empty -, avoids no obstacles)\n- Move L: to row 3, col 3 (G, goal reached)\n\nAlternate explored (mentally): Down then left loop (D L L L L L U) longer by 2, hits no walls but inefficient. Right detour (R U L6 D) hits row1 col12 if careless, dead end. Confirmed direct best.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace from start (3,8):\n1. L → (3,7): empty, in bounds (col7>0), no wall.\n2.

Patterns/constraints: The grid is mostly open, but walls create barriers. Key constraints: row 4 col 1 is a wall blocking direct left-side access from above; row 5 col 5 wall splits row 5 into left (cols 1-4 accessible to goal) and right (cols 6-7) isolated sections; row 3 col 1 is a near-dead-end; row 2 has walls at col 1 and 5, splitting it; row 4 col 1 wall isolates leftmost column somewhat. No diagonal moves; must stay in bounds (rows 1-5, cols 1-7); cannot pass walls. Manhattan distance: 2 down + 5 left = 7 moves minimum.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: General direction is down 2, left 5. Multiple paths exist (e.g., go left on row 3 then down twice; or down to row 4 first then left then down). Paths blocked: Cannot go leftmost on row 3 to col 1 then down (row 4 col 1 is wall) or up (row 2 col 1 wall)—dead end at row 3 col 1, forces backtrack. Cannot enter row 5 right side (e.g., row 5 col 6-7) and go left due to row 5 col 5 wall—traps player, unable to reach col 2 without backtracking up. Similarly, row 4 cols 2-7 open, but entering row 5 from row 4 col 6-7 leads to right-side trap. Dead ends/traps to avoid: row 3 col 1 (blocked U/D/L); row 2 col 1 (wall); row 5 col 6-7 (isolated); row 2 col 0 out-of-bounds effectively via left from col 1 (but col 1 wall). Alternate paths: (1) Left 5 on row 3 to col 2, down to row 4 col 2, down to goal (LLLLLDD)—safe, uses open row 3 corridor. (2) Down to row 4 col 7, left 5 to row 4 col 2, down (DLLLLD)—also safe, row 4 cols 2-7 fully open. (3) Mixed like LLDDD LLL, but same length. Paths that fail: Going up to row 2 or 1 unnecessary and longer (e.g., U then navigate around row 2 walls at col 1/5 adds detours); going full left on row 3 to col 1 then stuck; entering row 5 too right (e.g., DD from row 3 col 7 to row 5 col 7 then left blocked at col 5). Why certain approaches fail: Greedy left-first to col 1 traps due to adjacent walls; greedy down-right ignores horizontal splitters; no diagonals means must align vertically before final down. Generic strategy: Identify open corridors (row 3 cols 1-7 mostly, row 4 cols 2-7); subgoal to reach row 4 col 2-3 (safe entry to row 5 left); avoid splitter walls by entering target row from safe column; explore dead ends mentally via adjacency checks. Extensible: Use mental BFS/visual scan for small grids; for larger, prioritize main direction while flagging barriers; test alternates by simulating 1-2 steps ahead.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: LLLLLDD (left along open row 3 to align above goal column, then down twice—avoids all traps, minimal length). \n- Start: row 3 col 7. Move L → row 3 col 6 (open -). Navigates right edge safely.\n- Now row 3 col 6. Move L → row 3 col 5 (open -). Continues left in open corridor.\n- Now row 3 col 5. Move L → row 3 col 4 (open -). Midway left, no obstacles.\n- Now row 3 col 4. Move L → row 3 col 3 (open -). Approaching goal column.\n- Now row 3 col 3. Move L → row 3 col 2 (open -, avoids col 1 dead end). Now directly above safe entry.\n- Now row 3 col 2. Move D → row 4 col 2 (open -, bypasses row 4 col 1 wall). Navigates vertical to pre-goal row.\n- Now row 4 col 2. Move D → row 5 col 2 (G). Reaches goal, avoids row 5 col 5 wall by perfect alignment.\n\n# Verification\n\nTrace entire solution move-by-move from start row 3 col 7:\n1. L → row 3 col 6: in bounds, open (-), no wall.\n2. L → row 3 col 5: in bounds, open, no wall.\n3. L → row 3 col 4: in bounds, open, no wall.\n4. L → row 3 col 3: in bounds, open, no wall.\n5.

All other cells are empty (-). \n\nPatterns and constraints: The grid is mostly open space with sparse walls. Key constraints include bounds (cannot go above row 1, below row 10, left of col 1, right of col 7) and walls. Row 8 has walls at both ends (cols 1 and 7), trapping the starting row horizontally unless moving up or down. Upper walls at (4,4) and (5,2) create minor blockages but are distant from start/goal. Goal is adjacent but offset rightward and downward, requiring net movement: +1 row (down), +3 columns (right). No diagonal moves; only orthogonal U/D/L/R.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Multiple paths exist due to open space. Shortest paths are 4 moves (Manhattan distance 1 down + 3 right = 4, no detours needed). Possible paths include staying in row 8 rightward then down, or down first then right in row 9.\n\nBlocked paths: Cannot reach goal directly right along row 8 to (8,7) then down—(8,7) is wall. Cannot go left indefinitely on row 8 (blocked by (8,1)#). Upper walls block direct north paths if going up (e.g., from row 8 up to row 4 col 4 hits #), but irrelevant for goal direction.\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid: Row 8 left side (cols 1-2) is semi-trapped horizontally but escapable via up/down. Going up from start leads to open row 7/6 but unnecessary detour (adds moves to loop back down). Going down to row 10 then up is possible but wasteful cycle. Leftward from start (to col 2-3 row 8) requires circling right via row 9 or 7, longer (6+ moves). No true traps, but unnecessary up/left increases path length.\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily down (net +1 row) and right (net +3 cols). Prioritize right/down in flexible order.\n\nFailed approaches: (1) RRR D—third R hits (8,7)# invalid. (2) Pure up then right/down—detour through rows 1-7, blocked partially by upper #, much longer. (3) Left then loop—e.g., LL D RRRR, hits bounds/walls indirectly via extra moves. (4) Ignoring bounds—e.g., excessive D to row 10+ invalid.\n\nGeneric strategies: (1) Compute Manhattan distance for lower bound. (2) Enumerate adjacent valid moves (check bounds + no #). (3) Prefer moves reducing distance to goal (greedy heuristic). (4) BFS mentally for shortest path in grids. (5) Visualize/mentally map walls as barriers, identify chokepoints. Extensible to mazes: mark visited to avoid cycles; A* with heuristic for larger grids.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: RRDR (right-focused first to skirt row 8 wall, then down/right).

Player starts at row 4, column 6. Goal at row 3, column 5. Wall locations: single wall (#) at row 10, column 5. All other cells are empty (-).\n\nPatterns and constraints: The grid is overwhelmingly open with vast navigable space. The single wall is isolated near the bottom center and does not obstruct any direct or indirect path from the start to the goal. Key constraints include staying within bounds (rows 1-11, columns 1-6), avoiding the impassable wall, and reaching exactly the goal cell. No other obstacles, patterns like chokepoints, or loops present. Manhattan distance: |4-3| + |6-5| = 2 moves minimum. General constraint: up (U) decreases row number, down (D) increases it, left (L) decreases column, right (R) increases it.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Shortest paths require exactly one U and one L in some order (UL or LU), totaling 2 moves. Multiple equivalent shortest paths exist due to open space—no obstacles between start and goal. Longer paths possible (e.g., go left to col1, up, right to col5), but inefficient.\n\nBlocked paths: None directly to goal. The wall at (10,5) blocks only that cell; paths going down could hit it if exactly at col5 row10, but easily avoidable by shifting left/right. No paths to goal are blocked.\n\nDead ends or traps: None relevant to goal. The right edge (col6) prevents further R moves (out of bounds from col6). Bottom area has one blocked cell, creating a minor trap if blindly going D repeatedly to row10 col5, but open space allows easy escape (e.g., L/R then continue). No cul-de-sacs or loops forcing backtracking near goal.\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily up (to decrease row from 4 to 3) and left (to decrease col from 6 to 5). Minimal movement needed.\n\nApproaches that would fail:\n- Only R: Hits right bound at col6, increases distance.\n- Excessive D: Moves away from goal (upward needed), risks hitting wall at (10,5) if staying in col5, but even then, detour possible—still inefficient and longer.\n- U then R: Goes to (3,6) then out of bounds.\n- Loops (e.g., LRLR): Wastes moves, no benefit.\n- Ignoring bounds: Invalid moves like R from col6 rejected.\nGeneric strategy extensible to other domains: Compute Manhattan distance for lower bound. Visualize/use coordinates systematically. Prioritize directions reducing distance (greedy heuristic). Explore alternates via mental BFS: level 1 neighbors, check viability. Identify irrelevancies (distant walls). Avoid backtracking by confirming no blocks ahead. In complex mazes, mark visited to prevent cycles; here unnecessary due to openness.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: \"LU\" (left then up)—one of two minimal paths; selected for navigating left first to align column before row shift.\n\n- Current position: row 4, col 6\n- Direction moved: L\n- New position: row 4, col 5 (empty -, no obstacle)\n- Obstacles navigated: None; avoids right edge implicitly.\n\n- Current position: row 4, col 5\n- Direction moved: U\n- New position: row 3, col 5 (goal G)\n- Obstacles navigated: None; direct to target.\n\nAlternate explored: \"UL\" (up then left).\n- Start (4,6) -> U to (3,6) (empty) -> L to (3,5) (G). Equally valid.\nLonger alternate rejected: e.g., \"DLLUUURRR\" goes down-left, around imaginary blocks (none), back—works but 8 moves, teaches inefficiency.\n\n# Verification\n\nTrace entire solution \"LU\":\n1.

Player starts at row 5, column 6 (marked @). Goal is at row 5, column 3 (marked G).

Patterns include horizontal walls in rows 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, often clustered or spaced, creating corridors. Key constraints: cannot pass #, must stay within rows 1-10 and columns 1-12 (no out-of-bounds moves). Direct line-of-sight on row 5 from column 6 to 3 is clear (columns 5, 4 are empty, 3 is G). General pathfinding affected by walls blocking rightward and lower sections, funneling leftward movement.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nThe shortest path is direct left on row 5 (3 steps: LLL), as columns 5-3 are open. Multiple paths exist, e.g., go up to row 4 (open columns 1-7), left across, down to row 5 column 3 (longer, ~7+ steps). Or down to row 6 (fully open), left to column 3, up to row 5 (5 steps: DDL UU, but suboptimal). Blocked paths: right on row 5 hits # at column 10 after columns 7-9 open—cannot proceed further right without detours. From row 5 column 11-12, down to row 6 open but then row 7 # at 10 limits. Dead ends/traps: row 5 column 12 leads to row 9 column 12 # and row 10 scattered #, requiring backtrack; row 2 walls at 2,7,12 split upper grid into segments. General direction: primarily left (Manhattan distance 3 left, 0 vertical), stay same row. Approaches that fail: rightward exploration (hits # at row 5 col 10, forces long detour south then west around row 7/9/10 walls); immediate up/down without left progress (adds unnecessary vertical moves, risks wall traps lower); assuming open grid without checking (overlooks row 5 col 10 # but irrelevant here). Generic strategies: mentally map adjacent cells for local moves; prioritize shortest/Manhattan paths checking obstacles; explore branches BFS-style (queue possible directions, prune walls/dead ends); identify open corridors (e.g., full-empty rows as highways); backtrack from dead ends early; extensible to mazes/AI pathfinding via A* (heuristic: Manhattan + wall avoidance), graph search (cells as nodes), or visualization for small grids.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: direct left (LLL), shortest and obstacle-free.\n- Current position: row 5, col 6\n- Move L → New position: row 5, col 5 (empty -, no obstacle)\n- Current position: row 5, col 5\n- Move L → New position: row 5, col 4 (empty -, no obstacle)\n- Current position: row 5, col 4\n- Move L → New position: row 5, col 3 (goal G, destination reached, passable)\n\nAlternate explored mentally: up then left (U L L L L D, but row 4 col 6-3 open; longer, unnecessary).

Only one impassable wall at the bottom-center (row 5, col 3), which primarily blocks direct downward movement from the starting area but does not obstruct paths to the goal. Movement is restricted to orthogonal directions (U/D/L/R), must stay within bounds (rows 1-5, cols 1-4), cannot pass through # or G except as final destination. No other obstacles. Player can move to any adjacent - or final G cell. Shortest path likely involves minimal moves up (decrease row) and right (increase column), as goal is one row up and one column right from start.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple possible paths exist due to the open grid:\n- Direct shortest paths (length 2): 'RU' (right to (4,4), up to (3,4)) or 'UR' (up to (3,3), right to (3,4)). Both are optimal and unblocked.\n- Longer paths: e.g., 'LURR' (left to (4,2), up to (3,2), right to (3,3), right to (3,4)) or detours upward like 'UULRRDD' looping through top rows before descending, but unnecessary.\n\nBlocked paths:\n- Any path involving 'D' from start: down from (4,3) to (5,3) is # wall, impassable.\n- No blocks to goal, but paths going left/down excessively could loop inefficiently without dead ends.\n\nDead ends or traps to avoid: Minimal risk in this open grid. The wall at (5,3) creates a minor trap—if player goes down-left to (5,2) then tries right, hits wall—but start doesn't lead there directly, and from start 'D' is invalid anyway. No true dead ends; grid allows backtracking upward/left/right freely.

Check validity pre-move: bounds, not #. Prune invalid branches early (e.g., wall-blocked). Explore alternates to confirm optimality. Visualize coords systematically.

Player starts at row 4, column 2 (@). Goal is at row 8, column 5 (G). Walls (#) are located at: row 3 column 7, row 7 column 3, and row 7 column 7. All other cells are empty (-). Key constraints: walls block movement entirely (impassable), moves must stay within bounds (rows 1-10, columns 1-7), and movement is grid-based (U: decrease row by 1, D: increase row by 1, L: decrease column by 1, R: increase column by 1). Patterns: the grid is mostly open space, but walls in row 7 (columns 3 and 7) create a partial barrier at the lower levels, forcing navigation around column 3 in row 7. The upper wall in row 3 column 7 is isolated and unlikely to affect paths to the goal. Manhattan distance is 4 down + 3 right = 7 moves minimum.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations include finding a shortest or viable path while avoiding walls and bounds. Multiple paths exist due to open space, but some lead to dead ends. Direct path: move right to column 5 in row 4 (open), then down to row 8 column 5 (all cells in column 5 from row 4-8 are empty). This is optimal (7 moves). Alternate paths: going down first from start (e.g., DDD to row 7 column 2) reaches open cells but hits a dead end because row 7 column 3 is a wall, blocking rightward movement to column 5 without backtracking (from row 7 column 2, R hits # at column 3; U backtracks). Another blocked path: approaching row 7 from the right (e.g., go to row 7 column 7), but column 7 row 7 is #, and column 6 row 7 is open but leads to longer detours. Going left first (L to column 1) or up (U to row 3 or higher) moves away from goal, increasing path length unnecessarily and risking bound violations or irrelevance. Traps/dead ends to avoid: row 7 column 2 area (can't proceed right), column 7 lower rows (wall at row 7 column 7 and row 3 column 7). General direction: primarily down (net +4 rows) and right (net +3 columns), prioritizing rightward progress before descending past row 6 to avoid row 7 barrier. Approaches that fail: greedy down-first (trapped by row 7 #), left/up detours (suboptimal), or right to column 7 early (hits walls). Generic strategy: compute Manhattan distance for lower bound, visualize/mentally map obstacles to prioritize open corridors (here, column 5 is fully open vertically), consider obstacle shadows (row 7 # blocks horizontal at that level), use trial simulation of alternatives to identify dead ends early, prefer paths that maintain flexibility (e.g., horizontal before vertical barriers). Extensible to other domains: decompose into subgoals (e.g., 'reach safe column before barrier'), prune failing branches like BFS/A* search, balance greediness with lookahead.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: RRRDDDD (right along row 4 to column 5, then straight down column 5). This avoids all walls by staying in open column 5 vertically and navigating horizontally above the row 7 barrier.\n\n- Current: row 4 col 2. Move R.

A wall at row 3 col 1 blocks early left access on row 3. Row 4 col 2 wall blocks left passage on row 4. Row 6 col 2 wall separates the goal (col 1) from the rest of row 6, forcing approach from above (row 5 col 1) or carefully navigating around. Overall, need to move down 3 rows and left 3 columns (Manhattan distance 6), but walls prevent direct paths. Bounds (1-7) must be respected—no moves off-grid.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: General direction is down and left. Multiple paths exist, but many lead to dead ends due to walls. Shortest paths are around 6 moves.\n\n- Paths blocked: Direct left on row 3 hits wall at col 1. Direct down to row 6 then left blocked by row 6 col 2 wall (can't cross from col 3+ to col 1). Left on row 4 blocked at col 2 wall.\n- Dead ends/traps: Going left early (e.g., row 3 col 2) traps you—down hits row 4 col 2 #, left hits row 3 col 1 #, up retreats. Going up (row 1-2) is open but moves away from goal, wasting moves and risking row 1 col 4 wall. Going right/down-right loops around row 5 col 5 and row 6 col 6 walls but is longer (10+ moves).\n- Viable strategy: Go down first to bypass row 3 col 1 and row 4 col 2 walls, reaching row 5 where left passage to col 1 is open (row 5 cols 1-4 clear), then down to goal. This avoids traps by prioritizing vertical progress past upper-left walls before horizontal left movement.\n- Failed approaches: BFS-like exploration shows greedy left-first fails (dead end at row 3 col 2). Greedy down-first to row 6 col 4 succeeds partially but can't left to goal due to col 2 wall. Hybrid (down then left on row 5) works. Generic lesson: Identify blocking walls perpendicular to direction (here, vertical walls block left), so advance parallel direction first (down) to find open horizontal lanes. Prune dead ends by checking 1-2 moves ahead for escapes. Extensible to other domains: In pathfinding/AI, use obstacle-relative prioritization (e.g., skirts barriers), dead-end detection (no valid neighbors toward goal), and Manhattan-informed heuristics.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Down to clear upper walls, left on open row 5, down to goal.\n- Start: row 3, col 4\n- D → row 4, col 4 (open -, bypasses row 4 col 2 wall ahead)\n- D → row 5, col 4 (open -, now on row with clear left path to col 1)\n- L → row 5, col 3 (open -, navigates around distant row 5 col 5 wall)\n- L → row 5, col 2 (open -)\n- L → row 5, col 1 (open -, directly above goal, avoids row 6 col 2 wall)\n- D → row 6, col 1 (goal G)\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace:\n1.

Multiple paths exist due to open space; shortest paths are 11 moves. Direct path up column 8 to row 1, then left along row 1 works perfectly as column 8 is clear upward (no walls in rows 1-6, col 8), and row 1 cols 3-8 are open.\n\nBlocked paths:\n- Right from start hits wall at (7,9).\n- Bottom paths blocked by row 9 cols 3/7 and row 10 col 8 (e.g., cannot pass through (9,3), (9,7), or (10,8)).\n- Up-left paths might clip (4,5) if moving left too early (e.g., reaching row 4, col 5).\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid:\n- Going down from start leads to row 9/10 walls, creating semi-traps (e.g., from (9,8), cannot go left to (9,7)# or down to (10,8)#; must backtrack up or right, wasting moves).\n- Lingering in bottom rows risks unnecessary detours since goal is top-left.\n\nGeneral direction: Up to row 1, left to col 3.\n\nApproaches that fail and why:\n- Going right first: Blocked by (7,9)#.\n- Going down extensively: Leads to wall clusters in rows 9-10, requiring backtracking (e.g., down 2 to (9,8), then stuck left/down; adds 4+ extra moves to recover).\n- Aggressive up-left (e.g., left 5 first to (7,3), up 6 to (1,3)): Works but same length; however, if left 2 more to col 1 early, still open but unnecessary.\n- Trying to cut through (4,5): Impossible, as it's impassable; paths hugging it left/up would need to detour right/up around it, longer.\n- Staying in lower rows too long: Bottom walls force northward detour, inefficient.\n\nOptimal strategy: Clear vertical shaft in col 8 allows risk-free ascent to row 1, then horizontal left. Alternatives like left 3 then up 6 then left 2 are equivalent length but more turns; vertical first minimizes decision points.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: 6 ups along col 8 to (1,8), then 5 lefts along row 1 to (1,3). This avoids all walls, stays in bounds, and is minimal length.\n\n- Start: (7,8)\n  - Move U → (6,8) [empty, clear ascent]\n- Current: (6,8)\n  - Move U → (5,8) [empty]\n- Current: (5,8)\n  - Move U → (4,8) [empty; navigates right of (4,5)#]\n- Current: (4,8)\n  - Move U → (3,8) [empty]\n- Current: (3,8)\n  - Move U → (2,8) [empty]\n- Current: (2,8)\n  - Move U → (1,8) [empty, top row reached]\n- Current: (1,8)\n  - Move L → (1,7) [empty, start leftward]\n- Current: (1,7)\n  - Move L → (1,6) [empty]\n- Current: (1,6)\n  - Move L → (1,5) [empty]\n- Current: (1,5)\n  - Move L → (1,4) [empty]\n- Current: (1,4)\n  - Move L → (1,3) [goal G, success]\n\nThis path skirts the (4,5) wall by staying in col 8 and ignores bottom walls entirely.\n\nAlternate explored (for learning): Left first, e.g., L L L L L U U U U U U (to (7,3) then up). Hits no walls (row 7 cols 3-8 open, col 3 up clear except bottom (9,3)# irrelevant). Same length, but changes column earlier—useful if col 8 were blocked.\n\nFailed alternate: D D L (to (9,8) then try L to (9,7)#)—blocked, dead end-ish, forces backtrack (U U R or similar), adding moves.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace with positions after each move:\n1.

Player must navigate down 2 rows and left 2 columns overall, but cannot cross the wall at (3,3) from the right. No other major obstacles; top and bottom rows are fully open.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist due to open space, but the wall at (3,3) creates a key constraint: cannot move left from (3,4) to (3,3) or right from (3,2) to (3,3). Paths must approach the goal from above (row 2, column 2 down), from the left (row 3, column 1 right), or via detours around row 3.\nBlocked paths: Direct down-then-left (e.g., DDLL) hits wall—D to (2,4), D to (3,4), L to (3,3)# invalid. Similarly, DRLL or paths staying right of column 3 until row 3 trap you, requiring backtrack (e.g., from (3,4), cannot reach col2 without going up or around).\nDead ends/traps: Row 3 column 4 is a potential trap—if you reach it without having moved left enough, you're blocked left by # at (3,3) and cannot proceed to goal without reversing. Row 3 column 6 is open but leads away from goal. Going right/up increases distance unnecessarily.\nGeneral direction: Primarily down (net +2 rows) and left (net -2 columns). Safest strategies prioritize left movement before final down to row 3 to avoid the wall trap.\nFailed approaches: Greedy down-first fails due to wall (as above). Rightward exploration wastes moves and risks bounds at col6. Ignoring walls leads to invalid moves. BFS/DFS mentally: shortest paths are 4 moves; explore left/down branches first.\nGeneric strategies: Identify obstacles early, compute Manhattan distance (4 moves here: 2D+2L), prioritize moves reducing distance while checking blocks, avoid one-way traps by simulating forward.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: LLDD (prioritizes left to clear wall, then down; minimal and direct).\n- Start: row 1, col 4.\n- L: Move left to row 1, col 3 (empty -, navigates left in open top row).\n- L: Move left to row 1, col 2 (empty -, now aligned above goal column, avoids future wall).\n- D: Move down to row 2, col 2 (empty -, passes through open middle row).\n- D: Move down to row 3, col 2 (G, reaches goal directly from above, bypassing wall at (3,3)).\nThis avoids all walls by moving left early.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace:\n1.

Positions must stay within 1-6 rows and 1-8 columns.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Since there are no walls, every path that nets exactly 4 downs and 2 lefts (in any order) will reach the goal without obstruction, as long as bounds are respected.

However, detours like going right to column 8 require compensatory lefts later, increasing path length unnecessarily. Going up is impossible from start.\n\nGeneral direction needed: Primarily down (net +4 rows) and left (net -2 columns). Optimal to minimize extraneous moves (no ups or rights needed).\n\nApproaches that would NOT work and why:\n- Going up first (U): Invalid from row 1, out of bounds.\n- Going right then down without compensation: Reaches goal but inefficient (e.g., R DDDD LLL wastes moves).\n- Staying at top row and only moving left: Reaches row 1 col 5 but misses goal (wrong row).\n- Only moving down: Reaches row 5 col 7, adjacent but not goal.\n- Paths exceeding bounds: e.g., L six times from start hits col 1 wall (boundary), but recoverable with rights—not a dead end but inefficient.\n- Random zigzagging: Works but longer; teaches importance of net displacement planning.\n\nBest strategy: Direct path minimizing moves, e.g., lefts first to align column, then downs (avoids any potential bound issues near edges).

Player starts at row 6, column 5 (@). Goal at row 6, column 1 (G). Wall locations: row 2 column 5 (#), row 4 column 5 (#). All other cells are empty (-), passable. Patterns/constraints: Walls are exclusively in column 5 at rows 2 and 4, creating a partial barrier in the middle of column 5. No walls on row 6 or in columns 1-4 or 6-8. Player and goal are on the same bottom row (row 6), separated by 4 empty cells to the left. Moves must stay within bounds (rows 1-6, columns 1-8); up decreases row number, down increases it. Walls are impassable; goal cell is passable as destination. No other obstacles.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Shortest path is direct left along row 6 (4 left moves), as columns 4, 3, 2 on row 6 are empty, and goal at column 1 row 6.

Paths blocked: Cannot traverse column 5 upwards fully— from row 6 col 5 up to row 5 col 5 (ok), but up to row 4 col 5 hits wall; similarly row 3 col 5 up to row 2 col 5 wall. Dead ends/traps: Going right from start (to col 6-8 row 6) leads to edge (col 8), requiring backtrack. Going up column 5 hits walls, trapping if not planning left/right detours. General direction: Primarily left (net 4 left), no net up/down needed. Failing approaches: Assuming walls block row 6 (incorrect, row 6 open). Trying straight up column 5 to top then left (impossible due to walls at row 4/2 col 5). BFS-style mental search prioritizes shortest: direct left wins. Generic strategies: Model as graph (cells nodes, moves edges), shortest path via BFS/DFS avoiding walls/bounds. Visualize/mentally map positions. Check direct line first, then detours.

The wall at row 1 col 2 blocks passage to col 1 in row 1 from the right. The bottom wall at row 4 col 10 is irrelevant for reaching the goal on the upper left. No vertical walls or clusters; space is traversable southwest. Bounds prevent moves outside 1-4 rows, 1-11 cols. Manhattan distance: 2 down + 4 left = 6 moves minimum. Patterns: horizontal openness allows flexible left/down ordering.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple possible paths: Any sequence of 4 L and 2 D works if avoiding the row 1 col 2 wall.

No cycles/traps forcing loops due to openness.\nGeneral direction: Primarily left (net -4 cols) and down (net +2 rows).\nFailed approaches: U from row 1 (out of bounds). L5+ in row 1 (wall). Right-heavy paths (e.g., RRRR then left 8) longer (12+ moves) and risk bottom wall if down to row 4. Why fail: Violate bounds/walls or inefficient.\nGeneric strategies: Compute net displacement (delta row/col). Identify obstacles via mental grid scan. Simulate candidate paths (prioritize minimal moves). Prefer paths hugging safe zones (away from walls/bounds).

Key blocks on left side (Col 1: walls at rows 2,5,10) force rightward detours to progress upward. Bottom walls (rows 9-10) create potential traps if moving down excessively. Top-right wall (row 3 col 4) blocks direct access from right but irrelevant for goal at col 3. Empty cells dominate, but left-column walls necessitate right shifts before key upward moves. Overall, must net move 4 rows up (row 7 to 3) and 2 columns right (col 1 to 3), minimum 6 moves in Manhattan distance.\n\nGeneric strategy note: In grid pathfinding, always map obstacles relative to start/goal vectors (here, primarily up with right adjustment). Identify chokepoints (e.g., row 5 col 1 wall) early to prioritize detours.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Primary direction is up (decrease row by 4), with rightward shift to col 3. Multiple paths exist due to open spaces, but all require bypassing row 5 col 1 wall.\n\n- Possible paths: (1) Up to row 6 col 1, right to col 2, up through col 2 to row 3 col 2, right to goal (URUUUR). (2) Similar but right further to col 3 at row 6, up directly to goal (URRUUU). Both 6 moves. From start, right first to row 7 col 2, up to row 6 col 2, then same (RUUUUR, also 6).\n- Blocked paths: Straight up from start hits row 5 col 1 wall after row 6 col 1. Cannot go left (out of bounds). Row 2 col 1 and row 3 col 4 are irrelevant for this path but block hypothetical top-left or far-right approaches.\n- Dead ends/traps: Moving down from start (e.g., D to row 8 col 1) leads to row 9 col 3 wall and row 10 col 1-2 walls, creating a cul-de-sac; can escape up but wastes moves and risks looping in narrow space. Over-right to col 4 early is open but doesn't shorten path and hits row 3 col 4 wall if trying top-right.\n- General direction: Up and right; avoid left/down detours.\n- Failed approaches: Greedy up-only fails at row 5 col 1 (no lookahead for wall). Down-first explores irrelevant space, increasing search depth (extensible lesson: prioritize goal direction, use heuristic like Manhattan distance to prune). BFS-style exploration mentally simulates short detours first. No need for diagonal moves (orthogonal only).\n\nGeneric strategies: (1) Compute net displacement for lower bound. (2) Visualize/scan for proximal obstacles. (3) Test short detours around blocks. (4) Identify traps by checking boundary/cul-de-sac walls. (5) Verify alternates for robustness. Transfers to mazes/games: lookahead 1-2 steps, avoid backtracking in tight spaces.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: URUUUR (up via col 1 detour, right at row 6, up col 2, right to goal). Efficient, avoids all walls.\n\n- Start: row 7, col 1\n- U → row 6, col 1 (empty; navigates toward goal up, preps right detour)\n- R → row 6, col 2 (empty; bypasses upcoming row 5 col 1 wall)\n- U → row 5, col 2 (empty; clears the key left-wall block)\n- U → row 4, col 2 (empty; continues clear upward corridor)\n- U → row 3, col 2 (empty; approaches goal row)\n- R → row 3, col 3 (G; final right shift, avoids row 3 col 4 wall)\n\nAlternate explored: URRUUU (rights to col 3 at row 6, up col 3) also works, same length; chosen path uses minimal laterals early.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace:\n1.

No, but LL U to row 10 col 2, etc., still passable around). General direction: Primarily up (to row 8), slight right (to col 5).

The only obstacle is a single wall in the top row, far to the right. No other barriers exist. Player must move only U/D/L/R, cannot pass through # or go out of bounds (rows 1-5, cols 1-12). Manhattan distance is 4 up + 5 left = 9 moves minimum. The wall does not block direct paths to the goal since it is not in the left/top area.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Multiple paths exist due to open grid—e.g., go fully left then up, fully up then left, or interleave moves. All manhattan-length paths (9 moves) work if avoiding the irrelevant wall.\n\nBlocked paths: No paths to goal are blocked; the wall at (1,9) only affects top-right navigation. For example, a path going right/up then left across row 1 would hit it if passing col 9, but unnecessary here.\n\nDead ends/traps: None, as the grid is open. However, going right (e.g., to col 12) creates longer detours (extra left moves needed later). Bottom row is fully open, left edge fully open.\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily up (net 4U) and left (net 5L). Prioritize left/up in left column or up/left in column 6 to minimize risk.\n\nApproaches that fail:\n- Going excessively right: Increases path length unnecessarily, potential to hit wall if up then left across row 1 through col 9.\n- Ignoring bounds: e.g., 6L from start hits col 0 (invalid).\n- Up then right in top row: Hits wall at (1,9), dead end requiring backtrack.\n- Generic strategy extensible: Compute manhattan distance for lower bound. Visualize/mentally map obstacles relative to start-goal line. Prefer edge-hugging (left column) in open grids to avoid unseen traps. Explore alternates mentally: left-then-up (uses open left edge), up-then-left (uses open col6 up to row1, then left avoids wall). BFS-like thinking: from start, possible moves U/L (D/R away from goal). Avoid greedily going one direction if walls present (not here).\n\nChosen strategy: Left 5 to col1 (open bottom row), then up 4 (open left column). Simple, shortest, zero risk.

Row 2 is completely open, allowing free horizontal movement. The goal is accessible from above (row 2, col 1) or left (row 3, col 0), but right side of row 3 is walled off. Bottom row 4 is mostly open but ends with a wall at col 3. Overall, pathfinding must detour left around the row 1 wall, then navigate down and right in the open row 2 area. Bounds must be respected: no moves outside rows 0-4 or cols 0-3.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: The general direction needed is down (increase row from 0 to 3) with a slight left detour (to col 0) then right (back to col 1). Multiple paths exist once reaching row 2 (fully open), such as going right at row 2 col 1 directly down to goal, or down to row 3 col 0 then right, or even detouring to row 4 and up (longer but possible).\n\nBlocked paths: Direct down from start (row 1, col 1 is #). Right then down from (0,2) blocked (row 1, col 2 #). Entire right side in row 1 is walled.\n\nDead ends/traps: Moving right first to (0,2) leads to a dead end—no down (wall), no further right (wall/out of bounds), only back left. Bottom-right corner (row 4, col 3 #) is impassable; overextending right in lower rows risks it. Loops possible in open row 2/4 but wasteful.\n\nApproaches that fail and why:\n- Brute-force down: Hits row 1 wall immediately.\n- Right-heavy path: Trapped at top-right corner, can't progress down.\n- Ignoring left detour: No way to bypass row 1 wall without column 0.\n- Random wandering: Risks bounds violations or walls (e.g., right from row 3 col 1 hits #).\n\nGeneric strategies: Visualize grid mentally or sketch; identify barriers and chokepoints (here, row 1 wall forces left funnel). Prioritize open areas (row 2). Use systematic exploration like BFS (breadth-first search) mentally: test short detours first. Avoid one-way dead ends by checking escape routes before committing. Aim for goal's row/col incrementally while scanning obstacles.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Detour left to column 0 to bypass row 1 wall, descend to row 2, move right to align under goal, then down. This is efficient (5 moves), avoids dead ends.\n\n- Current: (0,1). Move L (left). New: (0,0) [empty '-'; navigates left around future down block].\n- Current: (0,0). Move D (down).

The wall at (2,4) blocks direct downward movement from the starting column. The wall at (5,2) blocks access below the goal in column 2 but does not impede reaching the goal itself. All other cells are empty (-). Player cannot move out of bounds (rows 1-6, cols 1-4). Moves: U (decrease row), D (increase row), L (decrease col), R (increase col). Manhattan distance: 3 down + 2 left = 5 moves minimum.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nOverall direction needed: primarily down (net +3 rows) and left (net -2 columns). Must avoid the wall at (2,4), which forces initial left movement before descending in column 4. The wall at (5,2) creates a potential dead end if pathfinding goes too far down in column 2, but since goal is at row 4, it is avoidable.\n\nMultiple possible paths: Several 5-move shortest paths exist, such as LLDDD (along row 1 left, then down column 2) or LDLDD (left, down in col 3, left to col 2, then down). Longer paths possible by detours (e.g., going to column 3 or 1 first).\n\nBlocked paths: Direct D from start hits wall at (2,4). Any R from start or right side hits right bound (col 4 max). U from row 1 hits top bound.\n\nDead ends/traps: Minimal traps due to open grid. However, after reaching row 2 column 4 is impossible (wall). If mistakenly D from (4,2) to (5,2), hits wall, but irrelevant for goal-reaching. No loops, but unnecessary detours to row 6 or column 1 increase path length without benefit.\n\nApproaches that would NOT work and why:\n- Direct down (D): Hits wall at (2,4) immediately.\n- Staying in column 4 and going down: Impossible due to wall.\n- Going right (R): Out of bounds.\n- Going up (U): Out of bounds from row 1.\n- Going too far down early in column 3 (e.g., from (2,3) DDD to (5,3)): Reachable but overshoots goal, requiring backtrack (inefficient).\n- BFS/DFS mentally: Prioritize left then down to hug the goal column early, avoiding right-side blockage.\nGeneric strategy extensible to other domains: Use Manhattan distance for lower bound. Identify local obstacles (e.g., wall blocking primary direction) and reroute around them. Consider bounds as virtual walls. Explore greedy (move toward goal) vs. systematic (column-by-column descent). Avoid backtracking by planning net displacements.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: LLDDD (shortest path, directly navigates around the top-right wall by moving left along row 1 to column 2, then descends straight to goal).\n- Start: (1,4)\n- Move 1: L to (1,3) - empty cell, avoids right bound and prepares leftward progress.\n- Move 2: L to (1,2) - empty cell, positions directly above goal column, bypassing wall at (2,4).\n- Move 3: D to (2,2) - empty cell, descends into open row 2 (wall is only in col 4).\n- Move 4: D to (3,2) - empty cell (row 3 fully open), continues toward goal.\n- Move 5: D to (4,2) - reaches G, no obstacle.\n\nAlternate path explored (LDLDD): L(1,3), D(2,3) [navigates around wall by dropping to row 2 col 3], L(2,2), D(3,2), D(4,2).

Still works, same length.\n\nBlocked paths:\n- Right to column 8 in row 4 hits # at (4,8); cannot proceed right further there.\n- In row 7, column 8 blocked; row 9 column 9 blocked—staying left/central avoids.\n\nDead ends/traps: Minimal risk. Column 9 row 9 is a single #, but no loops or enclosures. Going far right (e.g., to column 9 early) leads to partial blocks but can backtrack (e.g., from row 4 col 9 '-', but row 9 col 9 '#'). No true dead ends without backtracking, but inefficient.\n\nApproaches that fail:\n- Going left/up: Increases distance (e.g., L moves to col 1, requires extra R later; U to row 1 needs extra D).\n- Over-relying on right edge: RRRRRR from start hits (4,8) # on 6th R—invalid.\n- Ignoring bounds: No moves would clip here, but e.g., L from col 1 invalid.\n- BFS/DFS mindset: Generically, use mental BFS for shortest path (explore level-by-level by distance); here, no branches needed due to openness. Extensible: In denser grids, prioritize low-obstacle corridors, mark visited to avoid cycles, estimate remaining Manhattan to prune long paths.\n\nGeneric strategies: 1) Parse grid fully, note obstacle clusters. 2) Compute net displacement. 3) Test axis-aligned paths first (horizontal then vertical). 4) Simulate 1-2 alternates for validation. 5) Identify 'safe lanes' (open columns/rows). Transfers to pathfinding: Applies to mazes (dead-end pruning), graphs (A* heuristics), robotics (obstacle avoidance).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen path: RRRRDDDDDD (right along row 4 to column 6, then down column 6 to goal).

Vertical movement possible around col 6 barrier by using cols 1-5 or 7-8.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Manhattan distance is 2 left (same row). Shortest path: direct LL (2 steps). Multiple paths exist due to open spaces:\n- Direct left on row 7.\n- Detours: e.g., down to row 8, left twice, up (DLLU, 4 steps); or up to row 6/5, navigate left/down; or full loops via bottom (rows 8-11) or right side.\nBlocked paths: None on row 7. Examples elsewhere: cannot cross col 6 walls upwards (e.g., from row 5 col 6 # blocks up from row 6 col 6).

If blocked, compute Manhattan, prioritize low-cost directions. Explore BFS mentally (level-by-level expansion) for shortest/untrap paths.

Direct downward path (DD) is viable since column 4 rows 4-6 are open (-, -, G). Multiple paths exist, e.g., left then down-right, or up then loop down, but longer and riskier. Blocked paths: Right from anywhere in col 4 hits bounds. Up into top maze (rows 1-3) leads to dead ends, e.g., from (3,4) left to (3,3)- then up/down blocked by walls at (3,2)# and top bounds; cannot easily return south without backtracking. Down-left traps: From start left to (4,1), down to (5,1)-, but further down to (6,1)# dead end; must backtrack right. Walls at (6,3)# and (6,1)# split row 6, forcing col 2 or 4 approach to goal. General direction: Primarily down (south), minimal lateral movement needed. Failing approaches: Greedy left/down fails at (6,1)# trap. Exhaustive up exploration wastes moves in cul-de-sac top-left. Out-of-bounds right ignored. Generic strategies: Mentally simulate BFS/DFS for short grids—prioritize goal direction, prune dead ends by pre-mapping walls/bounds, backtrack mentally from obstacles, prefer straight lines over mazes (extensible to A* heuristics like Manhattan distance: here |6-4|+|4-4|=2, favors down).

All other cells are empty ('-').\n\nKey patterns: The grid is almost entirely open with no other obstacles. The player and goal are aligned in the same column (column 8), with the goal directly above the player (4 rows up). The walls are directly below the player in column 8 and adjacent in column 9, blocking downward movement but not affecting upward paths.

Manhattan distance is 4 (purely vertical), suggesting a short direct path exists.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Shortest path is straight up column 8 (4 U moves), as all cells from (6,8) to (2,8) are empty. Multiple paths exist due to open space, e.g., detour left to column 7, go up 4, right to column 8 (6 moves: LUUUUR); or right to column 9, up 4, left (6 moves: RUUUUL).

Wall locations:\n- Row 2, col 3\n- Row 3, cols 1, 3, 4\n- Row 4, col 2\n- Row 10, cols 1, 3, 5\n\nPatterns/constraints: Bottom half (rows 5-9) mostly open with full horizontal access; row 10 has blocking walls at odd columns creating obstacles for bottom navigation. Upper middle (rows 2-4, cols 1-4) has clustered walls forming narrow passages, dead-end pockets (e.g., row 3 col 2 trapped on three sides), and barriers to leftward progress. Column 1 open from row 5-9; row 5 fully open horizontally. Right column (col 6) open rows 1-10. Bounds: rows 1-10, cols 1-6. Moves: orthogonal only, impassable #, no diagonals. Manhattan distance: 3 up + 5 left = 8 moves minimum.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Need net 3U and 5L. Multiple viable paths exist due to open corridors:\n- Path A: Left 5 along row 8 (fully open -----@), then up 3 along col 1 (rows 5-8 col 1 all open: G- row5, ------ rows6-7, ----- row8 col1).\n- Path B: Up 3 along col 6 (rows 5-8 col 6 open), then left 5 along row 5 (G----- fully open).\n- Hybrids: e.g., left 2, up 3, left 3 (checkable but similar length).\n\nBlocked paths:\n- Row 3 leftward: open col 6-5, but col 4 # blocks to col 2/1.\n- Row 4 leftward: col 6-3 open, col 2 # isolates col 1 (only vertical access from below).\n- Row 2 col 3 # splits upper row.\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid:\n- Row 3 col 2: accessible only from row 2 col 2 (open), but blocked left (# col 1), right (# col 3), down (# row 4 col 2) → pure dead end, wastes moves.\n- Row 10 col 2/4/6: open upward but walls at col 1/3/5 prevent clean left progress; detour-heavy.\n- Upper left pockets (e.g., row 4 col 1 accessible but no further up due to row 3 col 1 #).\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily left then up, or up then left, staying in open bottom/right zones.\n\nFailed approaches & why:\n- Straight diagonal simulation (e.g., ULULUL): no diagonals; hits walls/bounds.\n- Downward exploration: row 9 open, but row 10 walls force zigzags (e.g., can't L across row 10 due to # at 1,3,5), longer path back up.\n- Upper crossing: entering row 3 from right hits col 4 #, can't reach left side without detour.\n- Ignoring bounds: R from col 6 or U from row 1 invalid.\n\nGeneric strategies: Visualize grid mentally/sketch; identify open corridors (full rows/cols). Mental BFS: explore moves level-by-level from start, prioritize goal direction (up-left), track position/visited to avoid loops. Prune invalid (wall/bounds). Explore alternates/dead ends upfront to build map.

Player starts at row 7, column 8 (@). Goal is at row 3, column 1 (G). Walls are located at: row 1 column 4, row 1 column 5, and row 10 column 9. All other cells are empty (-). Key constraints: walls are impassable and must be avoided; moves must stay within bounds (rows 1-10, columns 1-9). Patterns: the grid is mostly open with no walls obstructing the direct paths between start and goal. The top walls (row 1, cols 4-5) are irrelevant for reaching the goal at row 3 col 1, as we don't need to go to row 1. The bottom-right wall (row 10 col 9) is far from the path. Manhattan distance is 4 up (row 7 to 3) + 7 left (col 8 to 1) = 11 moves minimum. No diagonal moves; only U/D/L/R.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist due to the open grid. Primary strategies: (1) Go left 7 to column 1 at row 7, then up 4 to row 3 (LLLLLLLUUUU). (2) Go up 4 to row 3 at column 8, then left 7 to column 1 (UUUULLLLLLL). Both are optimal (11 moves) and valid since row 7 cols 1-8 are empty, row 3 cols 1-9 are empty (G is passable as destination), and intermediate rows/columns are clear. Interleaved paths (e.g., LLLUUULLL) also work but same length. Blocked paths: none directly to goal, but top walls block row 1 cols 4-5—if a path unnecessarily went to row 1 and tried those cells (e.g., up 6 from start to row 1 col 8, left 3 to col 5), it would hit #. Dead ends/traps: minimal; no enclosed areas. Going down/right leads away (e.g., down to row 10 col 8 empty, but right to col 9 hits #, forcing backtrack—wasteful, not trapped). General direction: primarily up and left (net -4 row, -7 col). Failing approaches: (1) Going down first increases row distance, requires compensation (e.g., D then many U—longer, inefficient). (2) Going right to col 9 then up/left—longer (extra 1 right +1 left). (3) Ignoring walls but hitting row 1 cols 4-5—impossible, as U from row 2 cols 4-5 blocked. Prioritize minimal moves, avoid detours.

No direct barriers between start and goal, but right side funnels toward blocked (6,8). Goal requires net movement: +3 rows (down), -3 columns (left). Manhattan distance: 6 moves minimum.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist due to open space in center-left. General direction: primarily down and left (3D, 3L ideally).

Dead ends/traps: Extreme right (row6 col8# prevents down-right); bottom-left (row8 col1# blocks if overshoot left-down); upper-left wall (3,2) irrelevant for down path but traps if go up-left unnecessarily. Approaches that fail: All-right then down (hits col8#); all-up then left-down (unnecessary distance, risks (1,7)#); looping in open space wastes moves but not fatal. Prioritize left-then-down or interleaved for efficiency. BFS-like mental search favors minimal moves: LLLDDD works perfectly (hits no walls). Alternate: DDL LLL D (longer, 7 moves); DLDLDL (6 moves, zigzags unnecessarily). Avoid right/up as they increase distance to goal. Generic strategy: Compute net displacement; identify local obstacles; explore primary axis (here down-left corridor); prune branches leading away from goal (e.g., right/up >5 moves already overshoot); extensible to mazes via greedy (toward goal) + lookahead for walls/dead ends.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: LLLDDD (minimal 6 moves, straightens path).

All other cells are empty (-). Patterns/constraints: A wall cluster in row 3 cols 4-5 blocks direct upward movement from the center-right. Lower-left walls (rows 5-7 cols 1,3,4) form a partial barrier, forcing navigation around the left or top edges. The top row has a single wall at col 4, isolating the goal somewhat from the right. Open corridors exist along row 2 (fully empty), row 4 (fully empty), and parts of row 1 left of col 4. Net displacement needed: up 3 rows, left 5 columns. Bounds must be respected (no row 0 or 8, col 0 or 9).\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations include identifying viable paths while avoiding dead ends. Multiple paths exist: (1) left along open row 4 to col 1, then up the open left column to row 1 col 1, right to goal (direct, low-risk); (2) up to row 3 col 7, left to col 6, up to row 2, then left across open row 2 to col 1-2 area, up/right (viable but longer); (3) down to row 5 col 7, left navigating lower maze to loop up (possible but inefficient, higher risk). Blocked paths: Direct up-left from start hits row 3 ## cluster (e.g., from row 4 col 5 up to row 3 col 5 #—impassable). Rightward from start leads to col 8 edge with row 6 col 8 # trap if descending. Dead ends/traps: Lower maze (rows 5-7)—row 5 col 4 # blocks leftward; row 6 col 3 # and col 8 # pinch points; row 7 col 1 # dead-ends bottom-left. Hugging right edge down risks row 6 col 8 #. General direction: Primarily up and left, prioritizing open rows (2 and 4). Failing approaches: Greedy up-left ignores row 3 ## (traps in col 4-5); bottom-loop wastes moves amid walls, risks exhaustion without progress (no cycles needed in grid). Generic strategy: Mentally BFS from start, prioritizing shortest/open paths; mark walls as hard constraints; explore 1-2 steps ahead to detect dead ends; prefer wide-open corridors over narrow/mazy areas for efficiency (extensible to larger mazes via A* heuristics like Manhattan distance adjusted for walls); backtrack virtually on blocks.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: LLLLLLUUUR (hugs open row 4 left, then ascends left column). \n- Start: row 4 col 7.

No full blockages between start and goal; pathfinding is feasible via columns 0-2 mostly. Key constraint: cannot pass # walls or go out of bounds (row <0 or >10, col <0 or >3). Manhattan distance: 4 rows up + 1 column left = 5 moves minimum. General navigation requires primarily upward movement with minor left adjustment, avoiding right-side walls at top and bottom-left wall.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Multiple shortest paths exist (length 5), such as going up first then left, or left first then up, or interleaved (e.g., up-up-left-up-up).

Top-right is semi-blocked but irrelevant for goal.\nDead ends/traps: Minor - bottom row 10 col 0 is impassable, so paths going down to row 10 and left trap you (cannot proceed up-left without backtracking, wasting moves). Right column 3 leads to dead-end at row 0 col 3 # if going too far up without left.

Identify net displacement (up 4, left 1). Avoid walls by column restrictions. Test alternates: simulate 2-3 paths, pick simplest. Backtrack early on dead-ends.

Player starts at row 5, column 1 (@). Goal at row 5, column 5 (G). Walls at row 8, column 1 (#) and row 8, column 6 (#). All other cells are empty (-).\n\nPatterns and constraints: The grid is almost entirely open space with only two isolated walls at the edges of row 8, creating no blockage on the direct path from start to goal. Both player and goal are on the same row (row 5), with columns 2, 3, 4 open between them. Walls do not affect row 5 at all. Bounds: rows 1-11, columns 1-6. Moves must stay within bounds and cannot pass through # cells. No diagonal moves; only U/D/L/R.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: The shortest path is directly right along row 5 (Manhattan distance: 0 row diff + 4 col diff = 4 moves). Multiple paths exist due to open grid (e.g., go up to row 1, right to column 5, down to row 5; or down to row 11 equivalents), but all are longer (minimum 4 extra moves for detours). Direct path \"RRRR\" is optimal and unblocked.\n\nBlocked paths: No direct blocks to goal; walls only block specific bottom-edge traversals (e.g., cannot move D from row 7 col 1 to row 8 col 1, or R from row 8 col 5 to row 8 col 6). To reach goal via walls would require impossible moves like passing through #.\n\nDead ends/traps: No true dead ends since grid is open and walls are isolated (can always backtrack). Potential traps: going left from start hits column 1 bound; going down col 1 to row 7 then trying further hits wall at row 8 col 1; similarly col 6 down. These waste moves but don't trap permanently.\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily right (net +4 columns), same row (net 0 row change). Avoid unnecessary up/down loops.\n\nWhy certain approaches fail:\n- Going left/up/down first: Increases path length without progress (e.g., L then R returns to start, 2 wasted moves).\n- Ignoring bounds: L from col 1 or R from col 6 invalid.\n- Assuming walls block row 5: Misreading grid leads to fake detours.\n- BFS/A* intuition: Prioritize minimal moves rightward; explore neighbors level-by-level to find shortest path. Greedy right-only works here due to openness. In mazes, track visited to avoid cycles.\n- Non-shortest paths: Going around walls (e.g., DDDD to row 9 col 1, RRRR, UUUU) takes 12 moves vs. 4—inefficient.\n\nExtensible strategies: Compute Manhattan distance for lower bound. Use systematic search (DFS with backtrack, BFS for shortest). Visualize grid mentally: scan rows/cols for barriers. Test direct line first, then detours. In other domains (e.g., chess king moves, robot pathing), same: state space (position), actions (moves), goals, obstacles.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Direct right along row 5, as it's open and shortest.\n\n- Current: row 5, col 1\n  Direction: R\n  New: row 5, col 2 (empty -)\n  Obstacles: None; straight open path.\n\n- Current: row 5, col 2\n  Direction: R\n  New: row 5, col 3 (empty -)\n  Obstacles: None.\n\n- Current: row 5, col 3\n  Direction: R\n  New: row 5, col 4 (empty -)\n  Obstacles: None.\n\n- Current: row 5, col 4\n  Direction: R\n  New: row 5, col 5 (G)\n  Obstacles: None; reaches goal.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace:\n1.

The walls in row 3 cols 3-4 create a partial barrier in the upper-middle, potentially complicating upward paths but irrelevant for downward movement. The wall at row 1 col 1 blocks top-left corner access slightly. The wall at row 8 col 2 blocks direct access below the goal but does not affect reaching the goal from above, left, or right. Player needs net movement: +2 rows (down), -4 columns (left). Bounds must be respected (no row 0/9, col 0/7). No diagonal moves; only orthogonal (U/D/L/R).\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nManhattan distance: 6 moves minimum (2 down + 4 left). Multiple paths exist due to open space in rows 5-7.

Row 7 is fully open (-G----), so clear.\n- Left-first then down: L x4 to row 5 col 2, then D x2 to row 7 col 2. Rows 5-6 fully open (-----@ becomes open after move, ------), row 7 open.\n- Mixed: e.g., L D L D L D or similar interleaving; all work in open area.\n\nBlocked paths:\n- Any move into walls: Cannot enter row 3 col 3/4, row 1 col 1, row 8 col 2.\n- Upward paths: Going U from start to row 4 col 6 (open), then left hits row 3 ## barrier (cannot cross cols 3-4 without detour up to row 2 or down, adding length >6).\n\nDead ends/traps:\n- Row 8: Mostly open but # at col 2 creates a block; entering row 8 col 2 impossible, and moving left/right in row 8 doesn't help reach goal (goal is row 7). Could trap if over-descend without leftward progress.\n- Upper area: Row 3 ## funnels traffic around it; left detour via cols 1-2 or right via col 5-6, but extends path unnecessarily.\n- Edge bounds: Right edge (col 6) has no further R; left col 1 open but no L from there.\n\nApproaches that fail:\n- All-up then left-down: Hits row 3 ## or row 1 #, requires backtracking (e.g., U U to row 3 col 6, L L hits ## at col 4/3, must U or detour, >6 moves).\n- Over-down to row 8 then up: Row 8 col 6 open, but to reach col 2 need to pass # at col 2 (cannot), and up from row 8 col 2 impossible anyway.\n- Staying high and snaking: Longer due to ## barrier.\nBest strategy: Stick to rows 5-7 (fully open corridors), combine L and D in any order totaling 4L + 2D.

Key patterns/constraints: Walls in row 3 (cols 4-5) block leftward movement from start but do not impede rightward or upward paths. Lower rows (5-6) form a maze-like structure with multiple walls, creating potential dead ends if descending. Upper rows (1-4) are mostly open, especially row 1 and 4 fully empty. Goal is nearby upper-right, requiring net movement: 1 row up, 4 columns right. Bounds: Cannot move outside rows 1-6 or cols 1-10. No diagonal moves; only orthogonal (U/D/L/R).\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Primary direction needed is up (1 step net) and right (4 steps net), minimal total moves around 5. Multiple viable paths exist due to open space above and right of start:\n- Direct right along row 3 to col 10, then up (RRRRU): Fully open, as row 3 cols 7-10 empty.\n- Up first to row 2, then right (URRRR): Row 2 cols 6-9 empty, col 10 goal.\n- Mixtures like RURRR, etc., also work.\n\nBlocked paths: Cannot go left from start due to walls at row 3 cols 4-5 (dead end leftward). Direct up-left blocked by row 2 col 5 wall. Downward paths risky: Row 4 open, but row 5 has clustered walls (cols 2,4,6-7), row 6 more walls; descending leads to narrow passages (e.g., row 5 cols 1,3,5,8-10 open but fragmented), potential traps like row 6 col 8 wall blocking right side. Loops possible in lower maze but inefficient/dangerous for pathfinding.\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid: Lower maze (rows 5-6) – e.g., entering row 5 col 5 leads to walls at col 6-7, forcing backtrack; row 6 col 1 open but walled at col 2/8. Upper-left irrelevant. Why certain approaches fail:\n- All-down then right/up: Hits lower dead ends, long detours.\n- Left then up/right: Blocked by row 3 cols 4-5 walls.\n- Over-right/up into row 1: Possible but overshoots goal.\n\nGeneric strategies: (1) Identify net displacement (here +4 right, -1 row). (2) Scan local obstacles for immediate blocks. (3) Prioritize open corridors (upper-right here). (4) Mentally simulate short paths first (BFS-like). (5) Flag risky branches (downward maze) as low-priority.

Dead ends/traps: No true dead ends, but wandering to row 10 column 7 hits wall (impassable), or edges cause out-of-bounds (invalid). General direction: Left 2 columns, same row (westward). Approaches that fail: Going right/down/up excessively leads to longer paths or bounds violations (e.g., RRR... hits column 7 bound; DDDDDD to row 10 then right to # dead-ends). Vertical loops waste moves without progress. BFS/DFS mentally: Prioritize horizontal since goal same row; explore neighbors left first.

Player starts at row 4, column 1 (@). Goal is at row 9, column 4 (G). Walls (#) are located at: row 1 column 6, row 1 column 9, and row 5 column 3. All other cells are empty (-). Key constraints: cannot pass through walls or go out of bounds (rows 1-10, columns 1-10). Patterns: the grid is mostly open space with only three isolated walls—two at the top row (irrelevant for downward travel) and one mid-grid at (5,3) that could block narrow rightward paths at row 5. Net displacement needed: +5 rows down, +3 columns right (Manhattan distance 8 moves minimum).\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist due to open space: primary options include (1) move right to column 4 first (3R), then down to row 9 (5D); (2) down to row 9 first (5D), then right to column 4 (3R); or (3) interleaved moves like down some, right some. Paths blocked by the wall at (5,3): any attempt to move right across column 3 at row 5, e.g., from (5,2) R to (5,3) fails. Dead ends/traps: minimal—open grid prevents true dead ends, but lingering at column 1 or going left from column 1 hits bounds; going up to row 1 encounters walls at columns 6/9 but doesn't trap since space is open. General direction: primarily down (majority of moves) and right; avoid row 5 column 3. Failing approaches: (1) Direct diagonal not allowed (only cardinal moves); (2) Going left/up first wastes moves and risks top walls but doesn't block goal; (3) Trying to cross (5,3) e.g., down to row 5 col 2 then right—hits wall, forcing backtrack; (4) Over-right beyond col 10 out of bounds.

Use wall-following or obstacle avoidance. Explore breadth-first mentally for shortest path. Avoid backtracking into known dead ends.

Key wall locations:\n- Row 1: columns 4, 12\n- Row 2: columns 4, 5, 7\n- Row 3: column 12\n- Row 4: none\n- Row 5: columns 4, 10\n- Row 6: columns 2, 12\n\nPatterns and constraints: Row 3 is fully open from column 1 to 11 (only column 12 blocked), forming a clear horizontal corridor. The goal in row 2, column 3 is directly above an open cell in row 3, column 3, with no wall blocking the upward move. Walls in row 2 (columns 4-5, 7) create barriers separating the right side (columns 8+) from the left side (columns 1-3), preventing direct leftward traversal in row 2. Row 1 has a wall at column 4, further isolating the left side (columns 1-3). Lower rows (4-6) are mostly open but introduce unnecessary detours due to walls in row 5 and 6. Moves must stay within bounds (rows 1-6, columns 1-12) and avoid # walls. Manhattan distance: 1 up + 6 left = 7 moves minimum.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Multiple paths exist, but the optimal is direct left along open row 3 to column 3, then up (7 moves, matches minimum). Alternatives include detours via row 4 (down first, left, up twice) or row 1/2 right side, but these are longer (10+ moves) or impossible without backtracking.\n\nBlocked paths: Going up early (e.g., U to row 2 col 9, L to row 2 col 8) dead-ends leftward due to wall at row 2 col 7; cannot reach column 6 or left without descending. From row 2 col 6 (reachable via row 3 col 6 up), horizontal movement blocked (left col 5 #, right col 7 #), requiring backtrack down or up to row 1 col 6, but row 1 col 4 # prevents crossing to col 3.\n\nDead ends/traps: Row 2 col 6 is a local trap horizontally (escape only up/down). Rightward from start hits row 3 col 12 # quickly (2R max). Lower paths risk walls in row 5 col 4/10 and row 6 col 2/12, creating mazelike dead ends if not careful (e.g., down to row 6 col 9, left blocked at col 2).\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily left (net 6 columns) with 1 up; exploit row 3 corridor.\n\nFailed approaches: Direct up-then-left fails due to row 2 walls (col 7 # blocks from right; col 4-5 # block to goal). Top path via row 1 right side fails at col 4 #. Bottom loops (down to row 6) inefficient and risk walls. Random moves risk bounds or #. Generic strategy: Identify open corridors (row 3), compute Manhattan, test direct path first, simulate barriers, prioritize shortest/no-backtrack paths (extensible to BFS/A* in larger grids/domains like planning under constraints).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: LLLLLLU (direct corridor exploitation).\n- Start: row 3, col 9\n- L: row 3, col 8 (empty; no obstacle)\n- L: row 3, col 7 (empty; continuing open corridor)\n- L: row 3, col 6 (empty; avoids potential up to trapped row 2 col 6)\n- L: row 3, col 5 (empty; staying under row 2 walls at col 4-5)\n- L: row 3, col 4 (empty; directly below row 2 col 4 #)\n- L: row 3, col 3 (empty; aligned under goal)\n- U: row 2, col 3 (goal G; no wall blocking ascent)\n\nObstacles navigated: Implicitly avoided row 2 barriers by staying in row 3 until final up.\n\n# Verification\n\nTrace entire path:\n- Start: (3,9)\n- 1L: (3,8) [row 3 col 8: - , in bounds, no #]\n- 2L: (3,7) [row 3 col 7: - , in bounds, no #]\n- 3L: (3,6) [row 3 col 6: - , in bounds, no #]\n- 4L: (3,5) [row 3 col 5: - , in bounds, no #]\n- 5L: (3,4) [row 3 col 4: - , in bounds, no #]\n- 6L: (3,3) [row 3 col 3: - , in bounds, no #]\n- 7U: (2,3) [row 2 col 3: G , in bounds, no #]\n\nConfirmed: No walls hit, all moves valid (U decreases row, L decreases col), stayed within 1-6 rows/1-12 cols, ends exactly at goal.

No patterns of walls or obstacles; the grid is completely traversable in any direction without restrictions other than boundaries (rows 1-6, columns 1-12). Key constraint: must stay within bounds and reach exactly (4,12) without hitting non-existent walls.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Since there are no walls, every path consisting of net +6 right moves (while balancing any up/down detours with returns) will eventually reach the goal, but efficiency favors minimal moves. Multiple possible paths exist: direct right along row 4 (shortest: 6 rights), detours like up to row 1 then right then down (much longer, e.g., 3U + 6R + 3D = 12 moves), or loops like left then right extra. No paths are blocked, but unnecessary detours waste moves and risk boundary issues if overdone (e.g., 7U hits row 0 out-of-bounds). No dead ends or traps since open grid—no loops or blocks to trap the player.\n\nGeneral direction needed: Primarily right (+6 columns), staying on or returning to row 4. Direct right is optimal as it avoids any vertical deviation.\n\nWhy certain approaches would fail:\n- Going only left/up/down: Never reaches column 12; drifts away from goal (e.g., all Ls go to column 1, dead end at boundary).\n- Over-upping (e.g., 6U): Hits row boundary (row 4-6= row -2, invalid).\n- Zigzagging excessively: Works but inefficient; e.g., U R D R repeated nets slow progress.\n- Staying on suboptimal rows: Not failing but longer if not direct.\nBest strategy: Shortest path via greedy right moves, extensible to pathfinding as BFS/DFS prioritizing minimal steps or Manhattan distance (here |12-6| + |4-4| = 6).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Direct right along row 4 (RRRRRR), as it's shortest and avoids any potential boundary risks in detours.\n- Start: (4,6)\n- Move 1: R → (4,7); no obstacles, straight empty.\n- Move 2: R → (4,8); continuing direct.\n- Move 3: R → (4,9); halfway, all clear.\n- Move 4: R → (4,10); approaching goal.\n- Move 5: R → (4,11); final approach.\n- Move 6: R → (4,12); reach goal.\n\nAlternate explored: UUU RRRRRR DDD (to row 1 and back)—works but 12 moves, navigates no obstacles but unnecessarily long; discarded for efficiency.

Player must move up (decrease row number), down (increase row), left (decrease column), right (increase column). Moves must stay within bounds (rows 1-7, columns 1-4) and cannot pass through walls. No diagonal moves. The goal requires net movement of up 2 rows and right 2 columns, but the wall at (6,3) forces a detour.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Shortest path length is 4 moves (2 up, 2 right in some order). Multiple possible paths exist due to open space above the walls, e.g., go up first then right, or interleave up and right after first up. Paths blocked: Direct right from start hits wall at (6,3), so 'R' first fails immediately. Any path trying to go right at row 6 from column 2 is blocked. Downward moves lead to potential traps: From (6,2) down to (7,2) (empty), but right is blocked by (7,3) wall, forcing left to (7,1) or up back, creating a detour and longer path (e.g., D L U U U R R R = 8 moves, inefficient).\n\nDead ends or traps to avoid: Bottom row (row 7) has a wall at column 3, so rightward progress is blocked there; going down risks getting stuck in bottom-left corner (7,1), from which escape is possible but circuitous (must go up multiple times). No true inescapable dead ends due to openness above, but they increase path length and risk bound violations if overextending left/down.\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily up (to row 4) and right (to column 4). Optimal strategy: Prioritize up to clear the wall level (row 6), then right. BFS-like mental search favors shortest paths avoiding walls.\n\nApproaches that would NOT work and why:\n- Starting with R: Moves to (6,3) wall → invalid.\n- Excessive down (e.g., DD): Hits row 8 out-of-bounds or traps in row 7 with no right progress.\n- Left-first (L): To (6,1), valid but adds extra right moves later (e.g., L U U R R R = 6 moves, longer).\n- Right at wrong height: Only possible after up to row 5 or above.\nGeneric extensible strategies: Represent state as (row, col); actions transform state predictably (U: row--, etc.); prune invalid states (walls, OOB); explore breadth-first mentally for shortest path; identify local obstacles and detour perpendicularly (here, up to bypass right-block).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: UURR (go up to clear wall level, then right to goal). This is shortest, avoids all traps.\n\n- Start: (6,2)\n- U → (5,2): Row 5 column 2 empty; navigates above starting wall.\n- U → (4,2): Row 4 column 2 empty; reaches goal row, avoids bottom traps.\n- R → (4,3): Row 4 column 3 empty; now free to move right on open row.\n- R → (4,4): Goal reached.\n\nAlternate explored: URUR\n- (6,2) U→(5,2) R→(5,3) U→(4,3) R→(4,4): Also 4 moves, valid (row 5 col 3 empty), but UURR simpler.\nDead-end example avoided: DR... → (6,2) D→(7,2) R→(7,3) wall (invalid).\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace of UURR:\n1.

All other cells are empty (-).\n\nPatterns and constraints: The grid is very narrow (only 4 columns), mostly open space from rows 1-4 and 6-9. Key obstacles are clustered at the bottom: row 10 blocks columns 2 and 4, creating a 'funnel' where passage to row 11 is only possible via column 1 or column 3 in row 10. The wall at row 5 column 1 partially blocks leftward access in the upper-middle, requiring detours to reach column 1 below it. No diagonal moves; must stay in bounds (rows 1-11, columns 1-4). Impassable walls force path planning around bottom chokepoints.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple possible paths exist due to open space: (1) Down column 3 to row 11 column 3, then left to goal (shortest, 7 moves). (2) Detour left to column 1 earlier (e.g., via row 6 column 1), down to row 11 column 1, right to goal (longer, 9+ moves). (3) Right to column 4, down to row 9 column 4, left to column 3, then down (unnecessarily circuitous).\n\nBlocked paths: Cannot descend column 2 beyond row 9 (row 10 column 2 is #). Cannot descend column 4 to row 10 (row 10 column 4 is #). In row 10, column 1 and column 3 are isolated (blocked by # in column 2). Direct left from start in row 5 hits wall at column 1.\n\nDead ends/traps: Entering row 9 column 2 and trying to go down traps you (cannot proceed down column 2; must backtrack left/right). Similarly, row 9 column 4 down leads to impassable row 10 column 4. Row 10 column 1 or 3 are safe but require down to row 11 for goal access.\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily down (6 net rows south), minor left adjustment (-1 column) at bottom. BFS/DFS mentally: prioritize down in open column 3.\n\nFailed approaches: Straight down column 2 (hits row 10 #). Staying in column 4 (hits row 10 #). Going up (wastes moves, no benefit). Ignoring bounds (e.g., left from column 1 crashes). Greedy left-then-down: blocked by row 5 column 1 wall, forces up/down detour (inefficient).\n\nChosen strategy: Column 3 descent (fully open), down to row 11 column 3 (safe), left to goal (row 11 fully open).

The player starts at row 1, column 3 (marked @). The goal is at row 1, column 5 (marked G). Walls (#) are located at: row 2 column 3, row 3 column 5, and row 5 column 1. All other cells are empty (-), passable spaces. Key constraints: cannot pass through walls (#), cannot move outside the 1-5 bounds for rows and columns. Patterns observed: a wall directly below the starting position at (2,3) blocks immediate downward movement; a wall at (3,5) blocks the bottom-right corner; a wall at (5,1) blocks the bottom-left corner. The goal is on the same row as the start, just two columns to the right, suggesting a potentially direct horizontal path, but we must verify openness and consider bounds/obstacles.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nThe primary goal is to reach (1,5) from (1,3). A direct path right twice (RR) checks out: (1,4) is empty, (1,5) is the goal. This is the shortest and simplest path. Multiple paths exist due to the mostly open grid, such as detouring left/down around the (2,3) wall, traversing the bottom, and returning up the right side (e.g., L D R D R U U or similar longer sequences). However, these are inefficient.\n\nBlocked paths: Direct down (D) from start hits wall at (2,3). From (1,4), down would go to (2,4) empty, but unnecessary. Cannot go up (U) from row 1 (out of bounds). The wall at (3,5) blocks any path trying to approach goal from below-right; must avoid entering (3,5). Wall at (5,1) creates a minor trap in bottom-left—if overcommitted left/down, might need to navigate around without getting stuck, but grid is open enough no true dead-ends exist.\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid: No absolute dead-ends (grid connectivity allows reaching goal from anywhere passable), but pseudo-traps like the (3,5) wall—entering row 3 column 4 leads nowhere rightward immediately, requiring down/up detour. Bottom row left blocked by (5,1), so cannot go left from (5,2).\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily right (net +2 columns), same row. Generic strategy: Mentally map grid (visualize or list positions), prioritize direct line-of-sight paths checking for obstacles/bounds; if blocked, identify blocking obstacle and find detour (e.g., go around left/right/up/down); explore branches breadth-first mentally to avoid long detours; prune failing moves early (illegal/immediate dead-end); extensible to other domains like maze-solving (A* heuristic: Manhattan distance), planning (obstacle avoidance), games (pathfinding algorithms).\n\nApproaches that would NOT work and why:\n- D first: Hits (2,3) wall—immediate invalid.\n- U first: Row 0 out of bounds.\n- L L L then try up/down: Stuck at left edge, but can recover down; inefficient.\n- R D R U: From (1,4) D to (2,4), R to (2,5), U to (1,5)—works but loops unnecessarily.\n- Paths through (3,5) or (5,1): Impossible, impassable.\n- Staying in row 1 leftward forever: Doesn't progress to goal.\nGeneric lesson: Eliminate illegal moves first, evaluate path cost (length), confirm endpoint.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Direct RR, as row 1 columns 4 and 5 are clear.\n- Current position: (1,3). Direction: R. New position: (1,4). Obstacles navigated: None—straight horizontal, cell empty.\n- Current position: (1,4). Direction: R. New position: (1,5). Obstacles navigated: None—adjacent to goal, passable.\n\nAlternate path explored (for learning): L D D R R R U U (to (1,2),(2,2),(3,2),(3,3),(3,4),(3,5)—wait (3,5)# invalid; correction: L D R D R U U: (1,2),(2,2),(2,3)—# invalid. Valid alternate: L to (1,2), D to (2,2), L to (2,1), D to (3,1), D to (4,1), R to (4,2), R to (4,3), R to (4,4), R to (4,5), U to (3,5)—# invalid; U from (4,5) to (3,5)# no. Better: after (4,5) U to (3,5)# fail—must U earlier: this shows detour complexity, prone to wall hits, reinforcing direct path superiority.\n\n# Verification\n\nStart: (1,3)\n1. R → (1,4): Bounds 1-5 yes; cell empty (-), not #.\n2. R → (1,5): Bounds yes; cell G (goal, passable). End at goal.\nFull trace confirms: No walls hit, all in bounds (rows/cols 1-5), exactly 2 moves, arrives at (1,5). No errors found. For alternate long path (hypothetical valid: L D L D R R R R U U U): Would work but 10+ moves, hits no walls, but direct better.

Player starts at row 1, column 2 (@). Goal at row 3, column 8 (G). Wall locations: (0,5), (0,6), (1,1), (3,5). Key constraints: Walls create blockages—upper walls at row 0 cols 5-6 prevent crossing rightward in top row; wall at row 1 col 1 blocks left from start; wall at row 3 col 5 splits bottom row, making row 3 cols 6-8 accessible only from above (row 2 same columns) or right side, but no right boundary access. Patterns: Open corridors in row 1 (cols 2-8), row 2 (all cols), row 3 (cols 0-4 and 6-8 separately); general need to move right (net +6 columns) and down (net +2 rows) while avoiding isolated wall traps.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist due to open middle areas (rows 1-2 mostly free). Primary direction: rightward to column 8, then down, or interleave downs earlier but ensure final down into row 3 col 8 bypasses (3,5) wall. Blocked paths: Cannot go left from start past (1,1) wall (dead end at col 0 row 1). Upper path blocked by (0,5)-(0,6)##—going up from row 1 cols 0-4 reaches row 0, but cannot cross to cols 7-8 without backtracking. Bottom-left trap: Entering row 3 cols 0-4 (e.g., down from row 2 col 4) creates dead end—cannot right to col 6+ due to (3,5)#; must backtrack up. Approaches that fail: Pure down-first to row 3 early (hits split); up-then-right (## blocks); left exploration (pointless wall). Viable strategies: Hug row 1 right to col 8 then down (avoids all walls); or row 2 traverse right then down at col 6-8. Shortest paths ~8 moves; longer loops possible but inefficient. Chosen: Row 1 right to end (safest, no obstacles), then down—minimal risk, extensible as 'greedy toward goal axis with obstacle preview'.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nStart: (1,2)\n- Move R: to (1,3); navigates open row 1 corridor.\n- Move R: to (1,4); continuing right, avoids future bottom #.\n- Move R: to (1,5); passes under upper ## safely.\n- Move R: to (1,6); still open.\n- Move R: to (1,7); nearing edge.\n- Move R: to (1,8); reaches rightmost column on row 1.\n- Move D: to (2,8); down into fully open row 2.\n- Move D: to (3,8); reaches G, bypassing distant (3,5)# by column alignment.\n\n# Verification\n\nTrace full path from (1,2):\n1.

No walls or obstacles in rows 1-4. Walls only appear in row 5 at columns 3 and 8, creating potential blocks only if descending further. The grid below row 5 is open, but irrelevant for this puzzle since the goal is in row 3. Direct line-of-sight paths exist with no intervening obstacles. Manhattan distance: |3-1| + |9-8| = 2 down + 1 right = 3 moves minimum.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations for solving the problem:\n- Multiple possible paths to the goal: Yes, at least 3 shortest paths of exactly 3 moves: RDD (right then two downs), DRD (down, right, down), DDR (two downs then right). All permutations of 2 D's and 1 R work because the 3x3 subgrid from row1-3, col8-9 is completely empty.\n- Which paths are blocked and why: No shortest paths blocked. Longer paths could be blocked, e.g., going down to row 5 column 8 hits wall (impassable), or row 5 column 3. Paths going left (to col7 or less) or up (out of bounds) are possible but detour unnecessarily.\n- Any dead ends or traps to avoid: Minor traps if overshooting down in column 8: D D D D from start reaches row 5 col 8 (wall), dead end requiring backtrack. Column 3 wall similar but farther. No loops or mazes; open space. Boundaries act as soft walls: can't go above row 1 or below row 12/left of col 1/right of col 10.\n- The general direction needed: Primarily down (increase row by 2), right (increase column by 1). Stay in columns 8-9, rows 1-3 to minimize moves.\n- Why certain approaches would fail: \n  - Only downs (DD): Ends at row 3 col 8 (empty, misses goal by 1 right).\n  - Only rights (R): Stays row 1 col 9, wrong row.\n  - Going left (L): Increases distance (goal col 9 > current 8), no benefit.\n  - Going up (U): Out of bounds from row 1.\n  - Long detours (e.g., left around imaginary obstacles): Unnecessary, wastes moves.\n  - Ignoring walls and going deep: Hits row 5 col 8 wall, forces backtrack.\nGeneric strategies extensible to other domains: Compute Manhattan distance for lower bound. Enumerate short paths (permutations for small deltas). Mentally simulate BFS levels (level 1: adjacent empties; level 2; level 3 reaches goal). Prioritize obstacle-free zones. Identify irrelevant obstacles (here walls too far). Avoid greedily following one axis if combined needed.

Player starts at row 3, column 2 (@). Goal at row 2, column 4 (G). Wall locations: single # at row 3 column 8; two ## at row 5 columns 3 and 4. All other cells are empty (-). Patterns/constraints: The grid is mostly open with no connected wall barriers blocking direct access to the goal. The walls form isolated obstacles: one far right on the starting row and a small cluster two rows below in the middle-left. No walls obstruct the upper-right direct path from start to goal. Boundaries prevent moves outside 1-7 rows and 1-10 columns. Net movement required: up 1 row (decrease row by 1), right 2 columns (increase column by 2). Minimum path length: 3 moves.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple possible paths exist due to the open grid, including direct shortest paths like RRU, RUR, URR, and longer detours like going down then around. Shortest paths (3 moves) stay in rows 2-3, columns 2-4, fully avoiding all walls. Paths blocked: Any attempting to pass through walls, e.g., moving right 6 times from start hits # at (3,8); paths through row 5 columns 3-4 are blocked there. Dead ends/traps: Going right along row 3 beyond column 7 dead-ends at # (3,8), forcing backtrack; entering row 5 between columns 3-4 traps briefly but can exit left/right/down since adjacent cells open. Going down to row 5 or below adds unnecessary distance and risks walls but doesn't fully trap (open below). General direction: Primarily up and right (net U1 R2); left or down initially workable but inefficient. Approaches that fail: Wall-crashing moves (e.g., RRRRRR from start); out-of-bounds (e.g., L from col1, U from row1); looping indefinitely without progress. BFS-like mental search prioritizes shortest paths by exploring neighbors level-by-level, marking visited to avoid cycles. Heuristics: Manhattan distance ( |3-2| + |2-4| = 3) guides toward goal; avoid walls by checking target cell pre-move. Generic extensible strategy: Decompose into net deltas (Δrow, Δcol); enumerate short sequences matching deltas while validating each step against obstacles/bounds; backtrack on failures; prefer low branching factor paths.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: RRU (shortest direct path, no backtracking needed). \n- Current position: row 3, col 2. Direction moved: R. New position: row 3, col 3 (empty -, within bounds). Navigated: stayed on open row 3, avoided distant wall at col 8.\n- Current position: row 3, col 3. Direction moved: R. New position: row 3, col 4 (empty -, within bounds). Navigated: continued right on open path toward goal's column.\n- Current position: row 3, col 4. Direction moved: U. New position: row 2, col 4 (G, within bounds). Navigated: direct up to goal, no walls above.\n\nAlternate paths explored mentally: URR ((3,2)->(2,2 empty)->(2,3 empty)->(2,4 G)); RUR same. Longer: DRRU (down to (4,2), right,right,up-up but wasteful). Failed approach: RRRRRR hits wall at (3,8).\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace from (3,2):\n1.

Avoids local traps.\n\nGeneric strategies extensible to other domains: Visualize grid mentally/draw; identify open corridors/blockers; compute Manhattan for lower bound; test short detours; eliminate failing directions early (pruning); use 'what if' for alternates (e.g., 'what if down first?').

Key obstacles include a wall at (8,3) blocking leftward movement at row 8 around column 3, walls at row 5 columns 6-7 blocking the right side near the goal row, and a minor wall at (3,6). Player must move up 4 rows (decrease row by 4) and left 3 columns (to column 2) while staying in bounds (rows 1-12, cols 1-7) and avoiding walls. Manhattan distance is 7 moves, suggesting a short path exists if unobstructed.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths possible due to open grid, but walls create constraints. General direction: primarily up and left (4U, 3L minimum). Chosen strategy: Move left first along row 9 (open columns 1-7 except player position) to column 2, then up straight through column 2 (open from row 9 to row 5). This avoids the wall at (8,3) by passing left of it at row 8, column 2.\n\nAlternative paths:\n- Up first: From (9,5) U to (8,5), then L to (8,4), but next L hits wall at (8,3). Blocked; must detour (e.g., U to (7,5), then LLL to (7,2), then UU), totaling 1U + 2L +1U +3L +2U = 9 moves, longer.\n- Rightward: Moves away from goal (e.g., R increases column), leads to row 5 walls at col 6-7; inefficient and risks bounds or blocks.\n- Down first: Increases row distance to goal (to row 10+), creates dead end as must return up later; wastes moves.\nDead ends/traps: Insisting on row 8 leftward past col 4 traps at wall (8,3); right side near goal row 5 blocked by ##, can't cross to left from right. Overshooting left to col 1 then right adds unnecessary moves. BFS-like mental search prioritizes left-then-up as it hugs the wall safely without detour. Failing approaches: Greedy up-then-left fails due to local wall; random zigzags inefficient.

Player starts at (row 2, col 5). Goal at (row 2, col 1). Key wall locations:\n- Row 0, col 0\n- Row 1, col 5\n- Row 2, col 3\n- Row 3, col 2\n- Row 4, col 1\n- Row 6, col 1 and col 5\n- Row 7, col 3 and col 4\n- Row 9, col 1\n\nPatterns/constraints: Walls create local blocks, e.g., (2,3) directly blocks straight left on row 2; (3,2) blocks row 3 leftward; vertical-ish walls in col 1 (rows 4,6,9) and col 5 (rows 1,6) limit up/down movement in those columns. Row 1 is mostly open leftward (cols 0-4 empty, col 5 wall). Bounds prevent moves outside 0-9 rows, 0-5 cols. No diagonal moves; only orthogonal. Goal is passable. Patterns suggest detours needed around central blocks on rows 2-3.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: General direction is left ~4 columns, same row, but (2,3) wall forces detour. Multiple paths exist: upper bypass via row 1 (open cols 0-4), lower bypass via rows 3-5+ (more mazey). Upper path preferred: shorter, fewer walls. From start (2,5), immediate U blocked by (1,5) wall, but L to (2,4) then U to (1,4) opens row 1 highway left to col 1, then D to goal.\n\nBlocked paths: Straight LLLL hits (2,3) wall. Initial U impossible. Lower path (e.g., D L L from start) reaches (3,3), but blocked left by (3,2) wall and up by (2,3) wall, forcing D to row 4+, longer detour around (4,1) wall.\n\nDead ends/traps: Lower grid has partial blocks like row 7 cols 3-4 (##), row 6 col 5 wall, row 9 col 1 wall—could trap if overcommit down without left progress (e.g., going deep right/down risks backtracking). Upper row 1 dead-ends only at col 5 wall (avoidable). Avoid greedy left (hits walls); instead, identify bypass corridors (row 1 open).\n\nWhy certain approaches fail:\n- Pure left/down greedy: Hits (2,3)/(3,2) walls, no immediate escape.\n- Down-first: Viable but 10+ moves (e.g., D L L D L D L U U L or similar), risks lower traps.\n- Right/up first: Right out-of-bounds; up blocked.\n- Generic strategy: Visualize/mentally BFS from start, prioritize short detours (up 1, left 3, down 1 = 6 moves). Extensible: In mazes, map local blocks, find adjacent open rows/cols for bypass; score paths by distance + wall avoidance; explore alternates to confirm optimality/dead-ends (teaches lookahead, prunes failing branches early).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Upper bypass (shortest viable).

All other cells are empty (-).\n\nKey patterns and constraints: The grid is mostly open space with sparse walls. Top row has walls at col2 and col9, potentially blocking upward movement near edges but irrelevant for downward/rightward travel. Mid-level walls at (7,6) and (9,6) create minor barriers in the lower center-right, possibly trapping if detouring too far down before going right. Bottom wall at (11,8) blocks near-goal depth but doesn't affect row6. Overall, open horizontal paths on rows 5 and 6 allow direct rightward movement. No walls block the primary right-then-down or down-then-right paths to goal. Bounds constraints: cannot move up from row1, down from row11, left from col1, right from col9.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Goal requires net movement of +5 columns right (col3 to col8) and +1 row down (row5 to row6). Multiple paths exist due to openness: e.g., go right on row5 to col8 then down (RRRRRD); or down first to row6 col3 then right (DRRRRR); or interleaved like RRRDRRR. Shortest paths are 6 moves (5R +1D in any order, as long as sequence avoids walls/bounds).\n\nBlocked paths: Direct up or left leads away from goal (dead end for efficiency, though possible to recover). Going far down (e.g., to row11) risks (11,8) wall but irrelevant since goal is row6. If moving right on lower rows past col6 (e.g., row7 col6 wall blocks straight right on row7; must detour up/left/right around it). Traps/dead ends: Aggressive down-right to row7+ col6+ hits wall at (7,6)/(9,6), forcing backtrack (e.g., from row7 col5, R hits wall; must U or L).

Player starts at position (4,4). Goal is at (1,1). Wall locations: (1,11), (2,10), (4,6), (6,9). All other cells are empty (- or G, which are passable).\n\nKey patterns and constraints: The grid is mostly open with only 4 walls, sparsely placed. The wall at (4,6) blocks direct rightward movement from the starting area. The top-right has walls at (1,11) and (2,10), potentially complicating paths from the right side. The bottom wall at (6,9) affects lower-right navigation but is distant from the goal. Left and upper areas are fully open corridors from row 6 to 1 in columns 1-3, and similar openness elsewhere except noted walls. Pathfinding must avoid walls, stay within row 1-6 and col 1-11. Manhattan distance is 3 up + 3 left = 6 moves minimum.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Multiple paths exist due to open grid. Primary direction: up (decrease row by 3) and left (decrease column by 3). A direct left-then-up path along the left edge (columns 1-4, rows 1-4) is viable and shortest (LLLUUU), as columns 1-4 are wall-free in rows 1-6 except irrelevant spots.\n\nBlocked paths: Cannot go right-right from start (RR hits (4,6)#). Paths through right side must detour up or down around (4,6), then left/up, e.g., R U LLL UUU (longer, 8 moves). Upper-right paths blocked by (2,10)# and (1,11)#, forcing leftward detour before reaching top row near col10-11.\n\nDead ends/traps: No true dead ends (grid connected, can always backtrack), but inefficient traps include: descending to row 6 near col9 (hits #, forces detour left/right); lingering right of col6 in row4 (blocked east); approaching top-right (can't enter (1,11) or cross (2,10)# easily). Bottom-right loop possible but wasteful.\n\nApproaches that fail and why:\n- All-right then up: Impossible, hits (4,6)# immediately after one R.\n- All-down then left/up: Works but very long (e.g., DDD LLL UUUU =10 moves), hits (6,9)# if not careful, inefficient opposite direction.\n- Up-right mix: From (3,4) R to (3,5), possible but must skirt (2,10)# later (e.g., go to col9 row3, can't go up-right), longer than left path.\n- BFS/DFS mental simulation favors left-up due to no obstacles.\nGeneric strategies: Prioritize Manhattan direction; scan for local blocks and choose open corridors; explore branches mentally (e.g., 'if left blocked, try up'); avoid opposite directions; extensible to mazes via 'greedy toward goal + backtrack check' or A* heuristics.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: LLLUUU (direct left to col1, then up; shortest, no obstacles).\n- Start: (4,4).

Up to goal, row1 col1 = G (passable).\n\nAlternate explored: UUU LLL (up first to (1,4), left). From (1,4) L to (1,3)..(1,1): row1 col1-10 empty except col11#, so valid but same length.

No full barriers divide the grid, allowing multiple paths. Key constraints include staying within row 1-12 and column 1-6 bounds, avoiding walls, and up (U) decreases row number, down (D) increases row number, left (L) decreases column, right (R) increases column. The wall at row 4, column 3 blocks direct diagonal progress if moving right early. Lower walls at row 9 col 6 and row 11 col 3 are peripheral and unlikely to block primary paths to row 7 col 2 but could affect longer detours. Overall, open space favors shortest paths downward and slightly rightward.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: From (3,1) to (7,2), net movement needed is +4 rows down, +1 column right (downward bias). Multiple paths exist due to openness:\n- Direct down column 1 to row 7 col 1, then right to goal: Avoids all walls.\n- Right to column 2 early, then down: Viable, e.g., R to (3,2), then DDDD to (7,2), checks clear (row 4 col 2 is empty).\n- More rightward paths possible but riskier.\n\nBlocked paths:\n- Early right to column 3 then down: From (3,1) RR to (3,3), D hits (4,3) # wall. Forces backtrack or detour left/down first.\n- Bottom explorations unnecessary as goal is mid-level (row 7).\n\nDead ends/traps: Minimal due to openness. Potential trap: Navigating to row 4 col 3 wall creates local blockage, requiring backtrack. Row 9 col 6 wall traps far-right bottom corner but irrelevant here. Row 11 col 3 could snag bottom-center loops but avoidable.\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily down (4 steps net), minimal right (1 step). Prioritize left-side paths to skirt early wall.\n\nFailed approaches:\n- Straight right then down: Hits row 4 col 3 wall, wastes moves on backtrack.\n- Unnecessary up or left: Out of bounds or away from goal, increases path length without benefit.\n- Ignoring bounds: Hypothetical moves like L from col 1 or U from row 1 fail.\n- Greedy shortest Manhattan (4D 1R) works if ordered correctly (down-first), but right-first greedy fails on wall.\n\nGeneric strategies: Visualize/mentally map grid. Compute Manhattan distance (5 steps) as lower bound. Check obstacles along vector. Explore primary path, then alternatives. Identify local blocks early. Use systematic search mindset (e.g., BFS: expand neighbors, avoid cycles via visited tracking). Test dead-end avoidance by simulating detours. Transferable: Break to subgoals (e.g., reach row 7 first), prune invalid moves pre-emptively.\n\nChosen path: Down column 1 to (7,1), right to goal. Shortest (5 moves), safe.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nStart: (3,1)\n- Move D: To (4,1). Empty (-), skirts left of row 4 col 3 wall.\n- Move D: To (5,1). Empty (-), open row.\n- Move D: To (6,1).

No walls obstruct column 9 or column 10 from bottom to top. Player must stay within 1-12 rows and 1-10 columns. Moves are strictly orthogonal (U/D/L/R), no diagonals. Manhattan distance: 7 rows up + 1 column left = 8 moves minimum.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Need to move primarily up (decrease row by 7) and left (decrease column by 1).

For example, a path hugging left wall to column 1 would hit row 1 col 1 if going to top, but irrelevant here as goal is column 9. No blocks on direct paths.\nDead ends/traps: None significant; left side (columns 1-5) open until row 1 col 1, but row 8 col 6 creates a minor blockage—if a path mistakenly goes left to column 6 at row 8, it can't pass up/down there, forcing detour right. Bottom-left corner is accessible but pointless dead end for this goal (long detour back). Avoid over-left moves early.\nGeneral direction: Up and slightly left. Shortest paths stick to columns 9-10.\nFailed approaches:\n- Going all left first (to col 1) then up: Longer (9 left +7 up=16 moves), risks row 1 col 1 if continuing up unnecessarily.\n- Ignoring walls and assuming full openness: Fine here, but in general, scan columns/rows for vertical highways.\n- Down/right moves: Increase distance, lead to bounds (row 12 bottom, col 10 right)—dead ends.\n- BFS/DFS mental simulation: Prioritize shortest (e.g., check col 9/10 openness).

Player starts at row 4, column 3 (@). Goal is at row 7, column 4 (G). Walls (#) are located at row 1 column 2 and row 5 column 1. All other cells are empty (-). Key constraints: moves are only up (U: decrease row), down (D: increase row), left (L: decrease column), right (R: increase column); no diagonals; cannot pass through or land on #; must stay within bounds (rows 1-8, columns 1-4). Patterns: the grid is mostly open with only two walls—one irrelevant at the top center (row 1 col 2) blocking minor upper access, and one at row 5 col 1 slightly restricting left-side downward movement from upper left. No complex mazes, but bounds and the row 5 col 1 wall create minor path limitations. General path requires net movement of +3 rows down and +1 column right.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist due to open space: shortest paths are length 4 (3D + 1R in any order, as long as avoiding the row 5 col 1 wall). Direct strategies work well: go right early to column 4, then down freely (column 4 is completely open from row 4 to 7). Alternative: down first to row 5 col 3, then right to col 4, then down (avoids wall easily). Paths blocked: cannot go left-down into row 5 col 1 (#)—e.g., from row 4 col 2 down hits wall. Dead ends/traps: minimal; row 5 col 1 is a local block—if path forces left to col 1 at row 5, stuck sideways but can backtrack up/down. Upper area (rows 1-3) is a detour trap (row 1 col 2 blocks full left traversal, wasting moves). General direction: primarily down (3 steps needed), with one right; prioritize column 4 for unobstructed downs. Failing approaches: (1) All left/up first—goes opposite direction, hits top wall/ bounds, requires backtracking (inefficient, risks bound errors). (2) Down-left into col 1 row 5—directly hits #, invalid. (3) Ignoring bounds, e.g., right from col 4 fails (out of bounds). Generic strategies: mentally map net displacement; identify open columns/rows; enumerate short sequences (BFS-like: try depth 4); flag obstacles as 'no-go zones'; prefer greedy toward goal but verify; explore alternatives to confirm optimality/validity; extensible to larger grids via prioritizing low-obstacle lanes.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: RDDD (right then three downs—optimal length 4, stays in open column 4). \n- Current: row 4 col 3. Move R. New: row 4 col 4 (empty, navigates to open right edge).\n- Current: row 4 col 4. Move D. New: row 5 col 4 (empty, passes row 5 wall on left).\n- Current: row 5 col 4. Move D. New: row 6 col 4 (empty, clear middle).\n- Current: row 6 col 4. Move D. New: row 7 col 4 (goal, open path end).\n\nAlternate explored: DRDD—from (4,3) D to (5,3) empty; R to (5,4); D (6,4); D (7,4)—also valid but same length. DDRD longer if detours.

Player starts at row 8, column 2 (@). Goal is at row 3, column 7 (G). There is a single wall at row 7, column 5 (#). All other cells are empty (-). Key constraints: must avoid the wall at (7,5), stay within bounds (rows 1-11, columns 1-11), and moves are only U (decrease row), D (increase row), L (decrease column), R (increase column). Patterns: the grid is almost entirely open, with only one obstacle creating a local blockage. The player needs to move up 5 rows (from 8 to 3) and right 5 columns (from 2 to 7), for a Manhattan distance of 10 moves. The wall at (7,5) blocks direct paths that would pass exactly through that cell but does not create chokepoints or enclosures.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist due to the open grid; any sequence of exactly 5 U and 5 R will reach the goal in minimum moves, provided it avoids landing on (7,5). Paths blocked by the wall include: (1) moving right along row 7 to column 5 (e.g., reaching row 7 at column 4 then R), (2) moving up into row 7 column 5 from row 8 column 5 (U from (8,5)), (3) moving left into it from row 7 column 6, or (4) down from row 6 column 5. Dead ends or traps: none exist, as the grid has no enclosed areas or loops; however, moving L or D increases distance from the goal (e.g., left from column 2 risks hitting column 1 bound quickly, down from row 8 goes to row 11). General direction: primarily up (net -5 rows) and right (net +5 columns), with no need for left or down. Approaches that fail: (1) Naive straight-line up then right works (UUUUURRRRR avoids wall). (2) Right then up also works (RRRRRUUUUU). (3) Up along column 5 then right fails if passing through (7,5). (4) Right to column 5 at row 8 then up fails (RRRUR... hits wall on U). (5) Zigzagging through (7,5) fails. Chosen strategy: move right first to column 7 at row 8 (avoids wall entirely, as row 8 column 5 is open), then up to row 3 (passes through row 7 column 7, which is open). This is efficient (10 moves), safe (no wall proximity until after bypassing), and extensible (prioritize horizontal/vertical sweeps in open grids, check obstacles in advance). Alternatives like up-first are viable but chosen path demonstrates right-then-up to skirt potential obstacles on the 'up-path'. Generic strategies: compute Manhattan distance for lower bound; simulate paths avoiding obstacles; prefer boundary-hugging or obstacle-circumventing orders; BFS mentally for shortest path in small grids.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen path: RRRRRUUUUU (right to column 7, then up to row 3).\n- Start: (8,2)\n- R: to (8,3), empty\n- R: to (8,4), empty\n- R: to (8,5), empty (wall is at row 7 col 5, not here)\n- R: to (8,6), empty\n- R: to (8,7), empty\n- U: to (7,7), empty (avoids wall at (7,5))\n- U: to (6,7), empty\n- U: to (5,7), empty\n- U: to (4,7), empty\n- U: to (3,7), goal\n\n# Verification\n\nTrace full sequence RRRRRUUUUU from (8,2):\n1.

The grid is mostly open in the top and middle, but the wall at row 4 col 3 creates a barrier that splits left and right paths downward. Bottom-right has clustered walls (row 6 cols 6-7, row 7 col 5, etc.), forming potential traps. Patterns/constraints: Need net movement of down 3, left 5 (Manhattan distance 8). Moves must stay in bounds (rows 1-9, cols 1-7). Walls impassable—no diagonal moves. Upper rows (1-3,5) mostly empty; row 4 has central block; row 6 has right-side block.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Multiple paths exist by circumventing the row 4 col 3 wall—either go left of it (cols 1-2) before descending or right (cols 4-7). General direction: primarily left and down. Bottom-right walls block direct descent on cols 6-7 (row 6 ##), so right-side paths require leftward shift before row 6. Dead ends/traps to avoid: descending too far right hits row 6 cols 6-7 # (e.g., from row 5 col 7 down impossible); row 7 col 5 # and row 8 col 6 # create narrow passages bottom-right, risking loops if over-left late. Alternate paths: (1) Full left on row 3 (6L to col 1), then 3D to row 6 col 1, R to goal (10 moves)—works but inefficient. (2) Descend right-side: 2D to row 5 col 7, 5L to row 5 col 2, D to goal (8 moves)—viable, skirts bottom walls. Chosen: Interleave left/down on right-side of row 4 wall (2L to col 5 row 3, 3D to row 6 col 5, 3L to goal, 8 moves)—minimal length, avoids traps. Paths blocked: Cannot down from row 3 col 3 (hits row 4 col 3 #). Straight down-right fails (row 6 col 7 # blocks). Overly aggressive bottom-right (e.g., row 5 col 6 down to row 6 col 6 # dead). Generic strategies: Compute Manhattan for lower bound; identify key obstacles and bypass options (left/right of barriers); prioritize open corridors; simulate short prefixes to prune dead ends; verify bounds/obstacles incrementally.

Player starts at row 10, column 2. Goal at row 2, column 8. Wall locations: (row 5, col 8), (row 9, col 7), (row 10, col 4), (row 10, col 7). Patterns/constraints: The grid is mostly open with only four walls, creating local blockages rather than large mazes. Key constraints include no movement through walls (#), staying within row 1-11 and col 1-8 bounds. Up (U) decreases row number, Down (D) increases it, Left (L) decreases column, Right (R) increases it. Net movement needed: 8 rows up (from 10 to 2) and 6 columns right (from 2 to 8). Walls create chokepoints: bottom row blocks direct right movement, row 9 col 7 blocks right-side ascent there, and row 5 col 8 blocks straight ascent up column 8 from below.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Multiple paths exist due to open grid, but all require detours around walls. General direction: primarily up and right, prioritizing upward progress while navigating rightward. Blocked paths: Direct right on row 10 fails (R from (10,2) to (10,3), then R hits (10,4)#). Straight up column 8 from bottom fails due to (5,8)# wall, creating a dead end if approached without left detour. Row 9 col 7 # forces a choice: go around left (up earlier) or right (down then up). Dead ends/traps: Entering column 8 below row 5 without planning a left detour at row 6 col 8 leads to blockage at (5,8)#; bottom-right corner (row 11 col 8 up to row 6 col 8) is a trap without lateral move. Alternate paths: (1) Hug left wall up column 2 to row 1 (9 U), right to col 8 (6 R), down to row 2 (1 D) -- safe but indirect (16 moves). (2) Bottom loop: down to row 11, right to col 8, up to row 6 col 8, detour left -- longer due to extra down/up. Chosen path: Early right on row 10 to col 3, up to row 9 and right to col 6, up to row 8 and right to col 8, up to row 6 col 8, then detour left/up/right to bypass (5,8)# -- efficient, avoids major detours. Failed approaches: Greedy right-first hits (10,4)# immediately. Greedy up-first then right works but doesn't teach obstacle navigation. No flooding or loops since no cycles trap permanently, but checking ahead prevents backtracking. Generic strategies: Identify local obstacles and plan modular detours (e.g., bypass each wall with L/R/U combo); use lookahead (simulate 2-3 moves ahead); prefer progress toward goal dimensions (up/right priority); explore alternates mentally via BFS-like layering to find viable paths extensible to larger grids/AI pathfinding (A* with Manhattan distance heuristic: |Δrow| + |Δcol|).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution navigates bottom walls first, ascends right side, detours around (5,8)#.\n- Start: (10,2) -> R -> (10,3) [navigates toward right before full block]\n- (10,3) -> U -> (9,3) [up to bypass (10,4)#]\n- (9,3) -> R -> (9,4)\n- (9,4) -> R -> (9,5)\n- (9,5) -> R -> (9,6) [max right on row 9 before (9,7)#]\n- (9,6) -> U -> (8,6) [up to open row 8]\n- (8,6) -> R -> (8,7)\n- (8,7) -> R -> (8,8) [reach right edge]\n- (8,8) -> U -> (7,8)\n- (7,8) -> U -> (6,8) [approach blockage]\n- (6,8) -> L -> (6,7) [detour left around (5,8)#]\n- (6,7) -> U -> (5,7) [safe up col 7]\n- (5,7) -> U -> (4,7)\n- (4,7) -> R -> (4,8) [right into open col 8 above wall]\n- (4,8) -> U -> (3,8)\n- (3,8) -> U -> (2,8) [goal]\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace:\n1.

Player starts at row 6, column 4 (@). Goal at row 1, column 5 (G). Walls: single wall (#) at row 2, column 7. All other cells are empty (-), passable. Key constraints: cannot pass through # or go out of bounds (rows 1-7, columns 1-7). Player must move only U (up: decrease row), D (down: increase row), L (left: decrease column), R (right: increase column). Patterns: the grid is almost entirely open, with the only obstacle in the top-right corner (row 2, col 7), which blocks direct access to row 1, col 7 but does not affect paths to col 5. No other barriers, no narrow corridors, minimal constraints on movement.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nNet movement required: 5 ups (U) to decrease row from 6 to 1, 1 right (R) to increase column from 4 to 5. Shortest paths are 6 moves (5U + 1R in any order), as long as they avoid the wall and bounds. Multiple possible paths: e.g., R then 5U; 5U then R; interleave like UURUUU, etc. All direct paths in columns 1-6 are viable since no walls there. Paths blocked: any attempting to traverse row 2, col 7 (e.g., reaching row 3, col 7 and moving U hits #). Dead ends/traps: none true dead ends due to open grid, but the top-right corner is a partial trap—if you go far right (to col 7) and up to row 3, you cannot proceed U to row 2 col 7; must detour left (L) to col 6 at row 2 or earlier, adding moves. Going left (L) or down (D) increases Manhattan distance (initial distance: 5 + 1 = 6), leading to longer paths without benefit. General direction: primarily up (north), slight right (east). Why certain approaches fail: (1) Over-right then up (e.g., RRRUUUU): hits wall at row 2 col 7, invalid. (2) Down or left first (e.g., DLLL...): moves away from goal, no walls to bounce off, just inefficiency; could loop forever but not trapped. (3) Staying at col 4 and 5U to row 1 col 4, then R: works but doesn't hit goal directly until last R. BFS/DFS mentally: shortest paths prioritize U and minimal R. Avoid greedy far-right due to wall. Extensible strategy: compute Manhattan distance, identify obstacles via visualization, prioritize goal direction, simulate short detours, prune paths hitting walls/bounds.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: R first to align column, then straight U to goal (avoids any potential right-side issues, minimal moves). Alternate explored: 5U then R—also valid, reaches (1,4) then (1,5). Another: UUURUU—valid. Rejected: RRRUUUU—in row 3 col 7 U to row 2 col 7 (#), blocked; fix by RRRLUUUU (detour at row 2), but 8 moves, longer.\n\n- Start: row 6, col 4\n- Move R: to row 6, col 5 (empty, aligns column early)\n- Move U: to row 5, col 5 (empty, progresses up)\n- Move U: to row 4, col 5 (empty)\n- Move U: to row 3, col 5 (empty)\n- Move U: to row 2, col 5 (empty, navigates left of wall at col 7)\n- Move U: to row 1, col 5 (goal G)\n\nNo obstacles encountered; path stays central, away from wall.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace:\n1.

Key constraints: Narrow grid (only 5 columns) limits lateral movement; walls in upper area block direct leftward path at row 2 column 2; lower maze-like walls (rows 6-10) create potential dead ends but are irrelevant for reaching the top goal. Patterns: Open top rows (1-5 mostly clear except isolated walls); clustered walls below act as traps. Overall, shortest distance is 1 row up and 2 columns left, Manhattan distance 3, but must avoid (2,2) wall.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic goal: Reach (1,2) from (2,4) efficiently while avoiding walls and bounds (rows 1-10, cols 1-5).

Alternatives like ULL also work but similar length.\n- Start: (2,4)\n- Move L: To (2,3) which is '-', navigates around future wall at (2,2) by not going further left yet.\n- Move U: To (1,3) which is '-', now in top row, bypassing (2,2)# entirely.\n- Move L: To (1,2) 'G', goal reached; top row fully open leftward.\nThis skirts the wall by sequencing left-up-left instead of left-left-up.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace from (2,4):\n1.

No loops or mazes; open grid avoids cycles.\n\nApproaches that fail and why:\n- BFS/DFS without bounds-checking: Could generate invalid moves (e.g., R from col 8).\n- Greedy 'always left then up': Works here but fails in mazes with blocks.\n- Ignoring bounds: e.g., UUU from start hits row 0 invalid.\n- Going down-right first: Wastes moves, risks wall if looping back left-down.\nOptimal strategy: Prioritize shortest net displacement (Manhattan distance 3), explore permutations of 1U+2L, verify bounds/emptiness. Extensible: Use A* with heuristic (Manhattan) for larger grids; here, enumeration suffices.\n\nChosen solution: LLU (simple, stays low then up).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nStart: (3,8)\n- Move 1: L → New position (3,7). Row 3 col 7 is '-' empty; navigated around nothing, direct left in open row.\n- Move 2: L → New position (3,6). Row 3 col 6 is '-' empty; continuing left, still clear.\n- Move 3: U → New position (2,6). Row 2 col 6 is 'G' goal; up avoids no obstacles, direct to target.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace:\n- Initial: (3,8) valid '@'\n- After L: (3,7) '-' no wall, bounds ok\n- After L: (3,6) '-' no wall, bounds ok\n- After U: (2,6) 'G' no wall, bounds ok, exactly at goal.\n\nNo errors found. All moves valid: no # hit, no out-of-bounds (cols 6-8 >=1 <=8, rows 2-3 between 1-6). Path length 3 (minimal Manhattan). Alternate ULL trace for completeness:\n- U: (2,8) '-'\n- L: (2,7) '-'\n- L: (2,6) 'G' also perfect. No wall interaction.

Player starts at row 2, column 2 (@). Goal is at row 3, column 3 (G). Key wall locations (#, impassable):\n- Row 1, columns 1 and 2\n- Row 2, column 3\n- Row 5, columns 2 and 3\n- Row 8, column 2\n- Row 9, column 4\n\nAll other cells are empty (-) and passable. Patterns/constraints: The grid is narrow (only 4 columns), making left/right movement limited. Walls form barriers: a top-left cluster blocking upward access, a wall immediately right of start blocking direct right move, a mid-lower barrier at row 5 cols 2-3 potentially trapping if descending too far unnecessarily, and minor lower walls. Goal is adjacent (Manhattan distance 2: 1 down, 1 right), but direct path blocked. Bounds must be respected: cannot go above row 1, below row 9, left of col 1, or right of col 4. No diagonal moves; only U/D/L/R.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Primary goal direction is down (to row 3) and right (to col 3), but direct 'R' from start hits wall at row 2 col 3. 'DR' circumvents by going down first to row 3 col 2 (empty), then right to goal. Multiple paths exist due to open space below:\n- Shortest: DR (2 moves)\n- Alternate 1: L D R R (go left to row 2 col 1, down to row 3 col 1, right twice: 4 moves, works but longer)\n- Alternate 2: D L R (down to row 3 col 2, left to row 3 col 1, right twice? Wait, D R is direct; this loops unnecessarily)\n- Longer detours: D D to row 4 col 2? But row 4 col 2 is empty? Wait, row 5 is -##-, so row 4 is before barrier.\n\nBlocked paths:\n- 'R': Hits wall row 2 col 3.\n- 'U': To row 1 col 2 (# wall).\n- 'UL': Left to row 2 col 1 (ok), up to row 1 col 1 (#).\n- Going far down (e.g., D D D to row 5 col 2): Hits row 5 col 2 # if trying right/down further.\n\nDead ends/traps: Descending into row 5+ without plan—row 5 cols 2-3 ## blocks middle passage; row 8 col 2 # and row 9 col 4 # create minor squeezes but passable around (e.g., col 1 or 4). No full dead ends near goal, but unnecessary descent wastes moves and risks barrier. Going left-up leads to top walls (dead end). Prioritize shortest path to goal using BFS-like mental search: explore neighbors level-by-level, prefer goal direction (down-right). Failing approaches: Greedy direct right (hits wall); random wandering down (works eventually via col 1/4 but inefficient); ignoring bounds/walls (invalid). Generic strategy: 1) Map positions/bounds/walls. 2) Compute directions to goal. 3) Simulate moves, prune invalids. 4) Evaluate paths by length/risk. 5) Verify full trace. Extensible to mazes/games: Use heuristic (Manhattan dist), avoid cycles via visited set.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: DR (shortest, direct, avoids wall).\n- Current: row 2 col 2\n- Move D (down): New position row 3 col 2 (empty -, navigates around right wall at row 2 col 3 by shifting down first)\n- Current: row 3 col 2\n- Move R (right): New position row 3 col 3 (G, goal reached; no further obstacles)\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace from start row 2 col 2:\n1.

Move R → row 3 col 3: In bounds, cell is G (passable goal), ok.\n\nNo walls hit, no out-of-bounds, ends exactly at goal. Alternate DR verified collision-free. Longer paths (e.g., L D R R):\nStart r2c2 → L r2c1 (-) → D r3c1 (-) → R r3c2 (-) → R r3c3 (G): Works but suboptimal. Error check: If mistakenly RD—R first to r2c3 (# invalid), corrected by swapping to DR.

All other cells are empty (-) and passable.\n\nPatterns/constraints: The grid is mostly open with minimal obstacles. The wall at (3,3) blocks the center column near the top, potentially obstructing upward paths through column 3. Bottom walls at row 9 are irrelevant for reaching the top goal but could trap if moving downward unnecessarily. No walls in columns 1,2,4,5 from rows 1-8, allowing free vertical movement there. Manhattan distance: 7 rows up + 3 columns right = 10 moves minimum. Must stay within bounds (rows 1-9, cols 1-5); no diagonal moves.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist due to open grid. General direction: primarily up (net 7 steps) and right (net 3 steps); order flexible except around obstacles.\n\nBlocked paths: Any path through (3,3) is impossible (e.g., straight up column 3 from bottom hits wall). Bottom row 9 has walls at col 3 and 5, segmenting it (col1-2 connected, col4 isolated unless from above), but irrelevant since goal is up.\n\nDead ends/traps: Moving down to row 9 leads away from goal; from (9,2) can go left to (9,1) or up, but right blocked at (9,3). No true traps, but inefficient detours (e.g., left to col1 then right later) lengthen path. Going left first to col1 requires extra right moves later (total right >3), suboptimal.\n\nApproaches that fail:\n- Direct up column 3: From (8,3) up hits (3,3) #.\n- Over-right then left: Hits col5 bound, must backtrack.\n- Ignoring bounds: Left from col1 or right from col5 invalid.\n- Downward exploration: Increases distance, risks bottom walls.\n\nViable strategies: Move right to col5 first (avoids (3,3) entirely, col5 fully open), then up 7. Or up column 2 first to (1,2), then right 3 (col2 open through row3). Or interleaved. Right-first chosen: simple, minimal turns, teaches prioritizing clear columns. Generic strategy: Compute Manhattan, check direct paths for obstacles, select obstacle-free corridor (here col5), verify alternate detours only if needed. Extensible to mazes: Identify 'highways' (open columns/rows), BFS for shortest, prune dead ends by backtracking lookahead.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen path: Right to column 5 (clear vertical path), then up to goal.

All other cells are empty (-) and passable.\n\nPatterns and constraints: The grid is mostly open space with only three walls, creating minor blockages. The walls in row 6 at columns 5 and 8 act as barriers that prevent vertical movement (up/down) through those specific cells in row 6, effectively creating local chokepoints for paths crossing row 6 at those columns. The wall at row 4 column 1 blocks the far-left upper area but is isolated. Player must move up 4 rows (from row 9 to row 5) and right 7 columns (from column 3 to 10), for a Manhattan distance of 11 moves. Moves must stay within bounds (rows 1-10, columns 1-12) and cannot enter walls. No diagonal moves; only U/D/L/R.\n\nGeneric strategy note: In pathfinding problems, always map start/goal coordinates, list all obstacles, compute Manhattan distance as lower bound, and visualize/mentally simulate the grid to spot blockages or open corridors. This transfers to domains like maze-solving or robotics navigation by prioritizing obstacle enumeration and bound checking.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple possible paths exist due to the open grid; shortest paths are 11 moves (matching Manhattan distance), achievable by any combination of exactly 4 U's and 7 R's without hitting walls or going out of bounds.\n\nBlocked paths: Cannot cross row 6 at column 5 or 8 (e.g., attempting U from row 7 col 5 lands on # at row 6 col 5, impassable). Cannot enter row 4 col 1. Paths going left (L) from start lead to longer routes (e.g., to col 1 requires extra 2 L then 9 R later, totaling 15+ moves) but are feasible since row 5 is fully open left-to-right.\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid: Navigating to row 6 col 5 or col 8 is impossible (wall), so paths planning to up through those columns fail (e.g., go right to col 5 at row 9, up to row 7 col 5, then U hits #). No true dead ends without backtracking since the grid is open, but local traps exist if ignoring walls. Going up-left to row 4 col 1 hits #, blocking further up, but unnecessary here.\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily up (net 4 U) and right (net 7 R); prioritize rightward progress while staying in safe columns (avoid 5/8 when crossing row 6).\n\nApproaches that fail and why:\n- Straight up at col 3 then right: Works (UUUU RRRRRRR), crosses row 6 col 3 (open).\n- Up at col 5: Fails; from row 7 col 5 U -> row 6 col 5 # (impassable).\n- Up at col 8: Similarly fails at row 6 col 8 #.\n- Going down first (D): Increases distance, hits row 10 bound, wasteful.\n- Going left to col 1 then up: Works but suboptimal (extra moves), and from row 5 col 1 can right to goal, but row 4 col 1 # irrelevant unless going further up.\n- Zigzag into walls: E.g., R R R R (to col 7 row 9), U U (row 7 col 7), R (row 7 col 8), U (row 6 col 8 #) fails.\n\nChosen strategy: Move right first to column 10 (open corridor all rows), then up to row 5.

Dead ends/traps: Early down to Row2 Col2/3 leads to # at Col4, forcing detour south into denser walls (Row5 Col4 #, Row6 #s), potential loops or blocks. Right edge (Col6) mostly #, impassable. \n\nMultiple paths exist but inefficient: e.g., left/down loop around lower maze back up, but risky dead ends (Row6 Col1/3/6 # cluster). Optimal/direct: Stay on open Row1, move right to Col5 (clear path: Col3/4/5 empty), then down—exploits unique access. \n\nBlocked paths: Direct Row2 traversal (D then RRR hits # at Col4). Over-right (to Col6 #). Down-first (traps in south, hard to return due to walls). \n\nGeneral direction: Primarily right (net +3 cols), minimal down (+1 row). Failing approaches: Greedy down (ignores # block), no backtracking awareness. Generic extensible strategy: (1) Identify goal adjacencies/backward search (goal only from up → target Row1 Col5). (2) Check linear paths first (Row1 right open). (3) Flag dead ends (Row2 left #) via local scans. (4) Mentally simulate short paths, prune bounds/#. (5) For larger domains: BFS/DFS with visited to avoid cycles, heuristic (Manhattan dist), or A* prioritizing open corridors.

General direction: primarily up 1, left 1; avoid right/up detours.

Avoid by prioritizing shortest path, mentally simulating BFS: level1 only (4,2); level2 includes goal.\n\nFailed approaches: Greedy right-first hits wall, fails immediately. Explore-everywhere (e.g., detour to top) wastes moves, risks loops. Ignoring bounds/walls leads to invalid states. Generic strategies: Model as graph (cells as nodes, valid adjacencies as edges), BFS/DFS for path; enumerate moves depth-first with backtrack; visualize net displacement; prune by walls/bounds.

No narrow corridors or loops, but end-of-row walls on row 4 could trap if over-approached.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple possible paths exist due to open space: shortest paths are 5 moves (e.g., RRRR D or variations like RRDRR, RDRRR, etc., detouring down/up slightly). Direct path along row 4 right to col 6, then down is optimal and intuitive.\n\nBlocked paths: Cannot move right from row 4 col 6 (hits # at col 7). Cannot pass through any #. Bottom row 11 walls irrelevant for short paths but could trap long detours. Top row 1 wall minor.\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid: Row 4 cols 7-8 are walls, so attempting R from col 6 dead-ends (impassable). Going left from start to col 1 row 4, then left hits bound. Bottom row 11: approaching col 4 or 7 risks isolation if detouring far down, but unnecessary. No looping traps, but inefficient loops (e.g., up/down repeatedly) waste moves.\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily right (net +4 cols), slight down (+1 row). Avoid up or excessive down/left to minimize distance.\n\nFailed approaches: Going up first (e.g., UUUU) reaches top wall quickly, requires detour around row 1 col 5 #, much longer. Going down to row 11 first hits distant walls, risks dead-end at col 4/7 #, and is 7+ down + rights = 11+ moves. Going left first moves away from goal, requires compensating rights later. Over-right on row 4 impossible due to ##. Pure down then right (D RRRR R? Wait, D to row5 col2, right to col6 row5) works but same length, no advantage. BFS would find shortest, but visually direct path clear. Generic strategy: Compute Manhattan, check direct line for blocks; if blocked, probe adjacent rows/cols for detours; prioritize low-obstacle zones; backtrack from dead ends.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Direct right along row 4 (clear path), then down—shortest, avoids all obstacles.\n\n- Start: row 4, col 2\n- Move R: to row 4, col 3 (empty -)\n- Move R: to row 4, col 4 (empty -), navigates open space\n- Move R: to row 4, col 5 (empty -)\n- Move R: to row 4, col 6 (empty -), avoids upcoming ## wall\n- Move D: to row 5, col 6 (goal G), final descent\n\nAlternate explored: RRRD R (to row 4 col 5, D to row 5 col 5 -, R to goal)—also 5 moves, but direct avoids unnecessary down/up. DRRRR (D to row 5 col 2, R x4)—works, but stays on goal row longer.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace:\n1. Start: (4,2)\n2. R → (4,3): empty, bounds ok\n3. R → (4,4): empty\n4. R → (4,5): empty\n5.

Tested alternate DRRRR:\n1. D (5,2) empty\n2. R (5,3)\n3. R (5,4)\n4. R (5,5)\n5. R (5,6) G—also valid. Direct chosen for row-aligned simplicity.

Player starts at row 5, column 2 (position (5,2)). Goal is at row 7, column 1 (position (7,1)). There are no walls (#) anywhere on the grid—all cells are empty ('-') except the player and goal positions. Key constraints: moves must stay within bounds (rows 1-7, columns 1-4); up (U) decreases row, down (D) increases row, left (L) decreases column, right (R) increases column. No patterns of obstacles, fully open grid allowing free movement in cardinal directions.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nThe grid is completely open with no walls, so all paths consisting of exactly 2 downs (to increase row by 2) and 1 left (to decrease column by 1) will succeed, as long as they respect bounds. Multiple possible paths exist, such as LDD, DDL, DLD, DL D (wait, DLD), or longer detours like R L D D (net same but extra moves). No paths are blocked since no walls. No dead ends or traps—any deviation (e.g., going up or right) doesn't trap you but adds unnecessary moves; you can always correct back. General direction needed: primarily down (south) to row 7 and slightly left (west) to column 1. Shortest paths are 3 moves.\n\nApproaches that would fail:\n- Going out of bounds, e.g., L from column 1 (invalid, stays put or error, but we avoid), or UUUUUU from row 5 to beyond row 1.\n- Excessive detours aren't failures but inefficient; e.g., going right to column 4 then left 3 times works but longer (RR LLL DD = 7 moves vs. 3).\n- No wall-related failures possible. In contrast to mazes with walls, no need for backtracking or BFS simulation here—direct vector calculation suffices (delta row +2, delta col -1).\n\nGeneric strategies extensible to other domains: Compute Manhattan distance (here 3) as lower bound. Prioritize moves reducing distance to goal. In walled grids, avoid # via A* or DFS with backtrack; here, greedy works. Explore branches mentally: from start, L viable (to col1 empty), R to col3 empty, U to row4 col2 empty, D to row6 col2 empty. Favor goal-aligned moves (D and L).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: LDD (shortest, directly to left edge then down; avoids any potential rightward drift).\n- Current position: (5,2)\n- Move L (left): navigates to empty cell at column 1, no obstacles.\n- New position: (5,1)\n- Move D (down): to empty row 6, column 1.\n- New position: (6,1)\n- Move D (down): to goal at row 7, column 1.\n- New position: (7,1)\n\nAlternate explored: DDL—D to (6,2) empty, D to (7,2) empty, L to (7,1) goal. Equally valid. DLD: D (6,2), L (6,1), D (7,1). All succeed.

The wall at (3,8) is in the upper-right area, which does not impede paths to the bottom-left goal. The wall at (9,3) creates a barrier in row 9, separating columns 1-2 (open) from columns 4-9 (open), preventing direct left-right traversal across column 3 in row 9. No other obstacles. Moves must stay within bounds (rows 1-10, columns 1-9); up decreases row number, down increases it, left decreases column, right increases it. Manhattan distance: 6 down + 4 left = 10 moves minimum.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple possible paths exist due to open space.

Key observation: Row 7 is completely open (G at col 1, '-' from col 2-12). Row 8 is completely open ('-' col 1-11, '@' at col 12). Row 9 has a wall at col 7, splitting it. Upper rows have barriers that narrow left-side access but do not affect direct paths to the goal. Net movement required: 1 row up (decrease row by 1), 11 columns left (decrease col by 11). Manhattan distance: 12 moves minimum.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Multiple shortest paths exist (length 12) due to fully open Row 7 and Row 8 adjacent to start and goal. Primary paths:\n1. Up to Row 7 Col 12, then left 11 along open Row 7.\n2. Left 11 along open Row 8 to Col 1, then up to goal.\nVariations: Any combination totaling 11 L and 1 U (U anywhere after sufficient lefts to avoid bounds/walls, but simplest are the two straights).\n\nBlocked paths:\n- Direct up beyond Row 7 from Col 12: Row 6 Col 12 open, but Row 5 Col 12 is wall (impassable).\n- Staying on Row 9: Wall at Col 7 blocks leftward progress across the row.\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid:\n- Row 9 left of Col 7 (Cols 1-6): Accessible via up from Row 8, but wall forces detour up to bypass Col 7, leading to backtracking and longer paths.\n- Isolated spots like Row 2 Col 12: Accessible but walled left (Col 11 #), requires down/right detours irrelevant to goal.\n- Left wall cluster (Col 2 in Rows 3-6): Narrows passage to 1 cell wide (Col 1 or Col 3+), potential bottleneck if pathing upper-left unnecessarily.\n\nGeneral direction: Mostly left (11 steps), minimal up (1 step). Prioritize open corridors (Rows 7/8).\n\nApproaches that would NOT work and why:\n- Going down first (D to Row 9 Col 12): Leads to Row 9 wall at Col 7; cannot traverse left fully without backtracking up (adds 2+ moves minimum, suboptimal).\n- All left then down/up wrong: Overshoots row.\n- Early excessive up from right side: Hits Row 5 Col 12 wall, forces left first.\n- Ignoring bounds: 12 L from start hits Col 0 (invalid).\n- Generic failure modes: Assuming walls block main path (they don't here); not checking row openness; greedy up without left (hits walls upper-right).\n\nExtensible strategies: (1) Identify open rows/columns for highways. (2) Compute Manhattan, seek straight-line corridors. (3) Mentally BFS layers: adjacent opens, scan for barriers. (4) Flag splitters (e.g., Row 9 Col 7 wall splits row into dead-end-ish zones). (5) Verify alternates for robustness. (6) Eliminate invalid moves pre-search (bounds, walls). Transfers to mazes/graphs: Pre-scan structure, prefer low-obstacle zones, avoid splitters.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Up first to enter open Row 7 highway, then left 11. (Alternative 11L then U equally valid; chosen for entering goal row early.)\n- Start: Row 8, Col 12.\n- U: Navigates to Row 7 Col 12 (empty '-'; avoids future upper walls).\n- L x11: Each shifts left on Row 7 (all empty '-'), no obstacles as row fully open.\nNo branches needed; direct.\n\n# Verification\n\nTrace entire solution (U L L L L L L L L L L L):\nStart: (8,12)\n1.

Player starts at row 7, column 11 (@). Goal is at row 1, column 4 (G). Walls (#) are impassable and located at:\n- Row 2: columns 4, 6\n- Row 3: column 9\n- Row 4: column 8\n- Row 5: columns 9, 11\n- Row 7: columns 3, 12\n- Row 8: columns 2, 12\n\nAll other cells are empty (-). Patterns include sparse walls creating mostly open vertical corridors in columns 1-12, except specific blocks. Key constraints: cannot pass walls or go out of bounds (rows 1-9, cols 1-12). To reach row 1, column 4, must enter row 1 by moving up (U) from an open cell in row 2 (open at cols 1-3, 5, 7-12; blocked at 4, 6). Row 1 is fully open horizontally, allowing left/right movement to column 4 once entered. Net movement needed: 6 up, 7 left (Manhattan distance 13). Bottom rows (6-9) are largely open horizontally, enabling leftward travel.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations prioritize finding safe, efficient paths leveraging open corridors while avoiding dead ends. Multiple paths exist due to open horizontal lanes in rows 6-9 and partial vertical paths upward.\n\n- **Multiple possible paths**: Fully open vertical corridors exist in columns like 5 (all rows open), 7 (all rows open), 1, 3, etc., allowing straight ascents to row 2 then row 1. Accessible from start via row 7 (open cols 4-11). Example paths:\n  - Row 7 left to col 5 (6L), up col 5 to row 1 col 5 (6U), left to col 4 (1L): 13 moves.\n  - Row 7 left to col 7 (4L), up col 7 to row 1 col 7 (6U), left to col 4 (3L): 13 moves.\n  - Right detour: up to row 6 col 11 (1U), right to col 12 (1R), up col 12 to row 1 col 12 (6U), left to col 4 (8L): 16 moves (longer).\n  - Mixed: left/up interleaving in open areas (e.g., left 3 on row 7, up to row 6, left more, up).\n\n- **Blocked paths and why**: \n  - Column 4 ascent: row 7-3 col 4 open, but row 2 col 4 # blocks entry to row 1 col 4 directly (cannot U from row 3 col 4 to #).\n  - Column 11 ascent: row 7-6 col 11 open, but row 5 col 11 # blocks further up.\n  - Column 6: row 2 col 6 # blocks row 1 entry.\n  - Bottom-left traps: row 7 col 3 # prevents leftward on row 7 beyond col 4; row 8 col 2 # blocks row 8 beyond col 3. Attempting left on row 7/8 leads to dead end without detour via row 6/9.\n  - Right edge: row 7/8 col 12 # limits options.\n\n- **Dead ends/traps to avoid**: Right-upper (row 5 col 11 # traps if ascending col 10-11 prematurely). Bottom-left walls create cul-de-sac if not using row 6/9 bypass. Upper walls (row 2 cols 4/6, row 3 col 9, etc.) funnel traffic to specific entry columns.\n\n- **General direction**: Primarily up (6 steps net) and left (7 steps net), prioritizing horizontal left on row 7 (open corridor cols 4-11) to reach an open ascent column (e.g., 5 or 7), then vertical up, final horizontal adjust.\n\n- **Why certain approaches fail**: Greedy up-first hits row 5 col 11 #. Straight to col 4 then up fails at row 2 col 4 #. Bottom detour (down to row 9, left, up) works but longer (~20+ moves). BFS-like exploration favors minimal detours; checking column openness reveals efficient lanes.\n\nGeneric strategies (extensible to other domains): 1) Map open corridors/landmarks (e.g., fully traversable columns). 2) Identify chokepoints (row 2 entries). 3) Verify start-to-corridor accessibility. 4) Simulate alternatives, pruning dead ends by backtracking checks. 5) Prioritize Manhattan-optimal paths. Transfers to mazes/graphs: decompose into subgoals (e.g., reach safe column), use A* heuristics, avoid local optima via global scans.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Move left along row 7 to column 5 (open corridor), ascend fully open column 5 to row 1 column 5, left to goal.

All other cells are empty (-), passable. \n\nPatterns and constraints: The grid is mostly open space with only two isolated walls. The wall at (3,6) directly blocks left movement from the start, forcing a detour. The wall at (5,1) blocks the far-left side of row 5 but does not impede paths to the goal at (5,5).

No loops or forced backtracks needed.\n- General direction: Primarily down (net +2 rows) and left (net -2 columns). \n- Alternate paths: (1) DLLD: Down to row 4, left twice to column 5, down to goal.

Longer paths like going up to row 2 first (e.g., U L L D D L) take 6+ moves.\n- Approaches that fail: Starting with L (hits wall). Starting with R (out of bounds). Going up and looping around (works but inefficient). Ignoring bounds like U from row 1 or L from column 1. BFS-like mental search prioritizes short detours around obstacles.\n\nGeneric strategies: Visualize grid mentally or sketch. Compute Manhattan for lower bound. Identify local blocks (e.g., wall forces down-then-left). Enumerate short sequences (permutations of 2D 2L). Check feasibility before committing.

Row 3 is completely open from column 1 to 8, allowing direct horizontal movement. The wall at (2,6) blocks vertical or diagonal paths that might cross row 2 column 6 but does not impede row 3. No other obstacles. Bounds must be respected: cannot go above row 1, below row 4, left of column 1, or right of column 8. Goal is passable.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Primary goal is shortest or viable path to (3,7). Multiple paths exist due to open grid:\n- Direct path: Move right 6 times along row 3 (RRRRRR). This is unobstructed, stays on open cells, minimal moves (6 steps).\n- Alternate paths: \n  - Go down to row 4, right across row 4 to column 7, up to goal: DRRRRRU (7 steps, longer).\n  - Go up to row 2, right to column 5, then detour around wall (e.g., down to row 3 column 5, right to 7): URRRRDRR (8 steps, unnecessary).\n  - Loop around top (row 1): UURRRRRDD (9 steps, inefficient).\nBlocked paths: Any attempt to move right on row 2 past column 5 hits wall at (2,6), forcing detour (e.g., from (2,5) cannot R; must U/D/L, creating longer path).\nDead ends/traps: Nearing (2,6) from left on row 2 leads to blockage—no way right without backtracking. Going left from start (L) hits bound at column 0 (invalid). Going up then left/right unnecessarily risks bounds or wall.\nGeneral direction: Primarily right (increase column from 1 to 7), same row. Minimal vertical movement needed.\nApproaches that fail:\n- Staying on row 2 rightward: Blocked at column 6.\n- Ignoring bounds: e.g., L from start or R 8 times from anywhere exceeds column 8.\n- Vertical only: No path up/down to goal without horizontal moves.\n- BFS/DFS mental simulation favors direct row 3 path as shortest, avoiding wall entirely. Generic strategy: Prioritize straight-line to goal, check for obstacles on path, explore detours only if blocked, consider Manhattan distance (here 6 right, 0 vertical = 6 min steps), avoid backtracking by planning ahead.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Direct right along row 3 (RRRRRR)—simplest, shortest, avoids wall.\n- Start: (3,1)\n  - Move R → New: (3,2).

Net movement needed: +2 rows (down), +5 columns (right). Patterns: grid is mostly open with only two isolated walls in row 5, creating minor blockages in the lower section but not obstructing direct paths to the goal in row 4. No walls in rows 1-4 or row 6, so upper and lower areas are fully traversable horizontally.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist due to the open grid. Primary strategic goal: move right 5 times and down 2 times in some order, prioritizing paths that stay above row 5 to avoid walls entirely. Simplest path: hug row 2 right to column 6, then down to row 4 (RRRRRDD) — fully open, shortest (7 moves), no backtracking. Alternate: go down early to row 4 column 1 (DD), then right (DDDDRRRRR, wait no: DD then RRRRR = DDRRRRR, 7 moves). Or zigzag, e.g., RRRDD RR (longer). Blocked paths: any attempting to pass through (5,2) or (5,6), e.g., reaching row 5 col 1 then right hits # at (5,2); row 5 col 5 right hits # at (5,6). Dead ends/traps: descending to row 5 col 1 creates a partial cul-de-sac (can't right to col 2, must detour down to row 6 or left/out-of-bounds); row 5 col 6 unreachable anyway. Row 6 is open but requires extra up moves to return north, inefficient. General direction: southeast (mostly right, some down). Failing approaches: left/up from start (wrong direction, hits bounds quickly); descending too early into row 5 without planning around walls (e.g., DRRRR D hits wall if misordered); ignoring bounds (e.g., 6R from col 1 goes out). BFS/DFS mentally: prioritize shortest paths avoiding walls, expand from open cells. Extensible strategy: decompose into net deltas (dx=5 right, dy=2 down), test permutations avoiding obstacles; use 'wall-shadowing' to identify safe corridors (e.g., rows 1-4 fully safe).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen: RRRRRDD (efficient, stays in safe upper rows). Start: (2,1). Move R to (2,2): empty, progressing right along open row 2, avoiding any premature descent. R to (2,3): empty. R to (2,4): empty. R to (2,5): empty. R to (2,6): empty, now at east edge.

Key constraints: Walls form a barrier in row 3 columns 2-3, blocking direct rightward movement from the start. A wall at (2,2) partially obstructs upward paths. No diagonal moves allowed; only orthogonal (U/D/L/R). General patterns: Open row 1 and row 4; row 2 has a single wall in column 2; row 3 has consecutive walls in columns 2-3, creating a 'dead end' feel on the right side from the start.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist to the goal, but the shortest and simplest is downward first to row 4 (fully open), then rightward. This avoids all walls entirely. Alternative paths include going upward to row 1 (fully open), traversing right across row 1, then descending on the right side (e.g., via column 4 or column 3 where possible), but these are longer (minimum 7-9 moves) due to detours. Paths blocked: Direct right from start hits wall at (3,2). From (3,1) up to (2,1), right is blocked by (2,2). Down-right attempts fail initially due to walls. Dead ends/traps: (3,4) is accessible but leads to wall at (3,3) if trying left; (2,1) is a near-dead-end (only up or back down viable). General direction needed: Net movement of +1 row (down), +2 columns (right). BFS/DFS mentally: Prioritize down-right over up due to fewer obstacles below. Approaches that fail: Greedy right-first (immediate wall); up-then-right-immediate (wall at (2,2)); staying in row 3 rightward (double wall).

Shortest paths stay in top rows to avoid unnecessary detours.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily left (4 columns) and down (1 row), minimal up or right needed.\n\nMultiple possible paths:\n- Path A: Move left on row 1 to column 1, then down to goal (LLLLD, 5 moves).\n- Path B: Down to row 2 column 5, then left to column 1 (DLLLL, 5 moves).\n- Longer paths: Go right first, loop around walls below (e.g., right, down multiple times, left around row 6 walls), but inefficient (10+ moves).\n\nBlocked paths:\n- Direct left-down mix might hit nothing immediately, but going down to row 3 early and left hits walls at row 3 col 2-3 (e.g., D L L from start -> row 3 col 3 # blocked).\n- Going deep down (to row 6+) then left: row 6 col 2 and 5 # require detours (e.g., to avoid col 2 #, go to col 1 row 6 then up, but longer and risks bounds).\n\nDead ends/traps:\n- Row 3 col 2-3: Trap if enter row 3 col 4 and try left (blocked), must go down or right.\n- Row 6 col 2 #: Can't pass leftward without going around (up or down to row 7).\n- Bottom-right corner: No walls, but far from goal.\n- No true dead ends (grid open enough), but walls create mazelike local blocks.\n\nApproaches that fail:\n- Going up from row 1: Out of bounds (invalid).\n- Right then up: Useless, longer.\n- Ignoring walls and plunging down-left: Hits row 3 ## (e.g., DDLL -> row 3 col 3 #).\n- Shortest path assumption without checking: Both 5-move paths work; BFS would find them equally.\n\nBest strategy: Stay in open top rows (1-2). Prefer simple monotonic paths (left then down or down then left) as they avoid all walls. Extensible: Prioritize adjacent rows/columns first (Manhattan distance: 5 moves min), check local obstacles, explore breadth-first mentally to avoid deep dead ends.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: LLLLD (left on row 1 to col 1, then down). Alternative DLLLL equally valid, but this keeps horizontal move on open row 1.\n\nStart: (1,5)\n- Move L -> (1,4) [empty, continuing left]\n- Move L -> (1,3) [empty]\n- Move L -> (1,2) [empty]\n- Move L -> (1,1) [empty, left edge]\n- Move D -> (2,1) [goal, navigated around no obstacles as row 1 fully open]\n\nThis avoids row 3 walls entirely by staying top.\n\n# Verification\n\nTrace full path:\n1. Start: (1,5)\n2. L -> (1,4): bounds ok, -\n3. L -> (1,3): bounds ok, -\n4. L -> (1,2): bounds ok, -\n5. L -> (1,1): bounds ok, -\n6. D -> (2,1): bounds ok, G (no wall)\n\nNo walls hit.

Row 6 has ## in cols 4-5, creating a barrier mid-grid. Row 8 has staggered # in cols 2 and 4. Row 10 has # flanking the goal (cols 1 and 4), so goal inaccessible directly from left on row 10 or below on col 5 (row 11 col 5 is #). Row 9 and row 11 (partially) are mostly open. Row 1,4,7,9 fully open horizontally. Bounds prevent moves outside 1-11 rows, 1-6 cols.

General direction: up 2 rows to row 9, right 3 cols to col 5, down 1 to goal. Paths blocked: (1) Right along row 11 (RR to row 11 col 4, then R hits row 11 col 5 #; U hits row 10 col 4 #) -- dead end, forces backtrack. (2) Up then right on row 10 (U to row 10 col 2, RR hits row 10 col 4 #) -- blocked, can't reach col 5 directly. (3) Left from start (L to row 11 col 1, U hits row 10 col 1 #) -- trap, isolated pocket. Dead ends/traps to avoid: Bottom-left corner (row 11 col 1), inaccessible upward; mid-left (row 5 col 2 # blocks); row 6 cols 4-5 ## creates cul-de-sac if entered from left. Alternate paths: Go further up (e.g., to row 7/8 via row 9 left/up, circle around row 8 #'s to row 10 col 6, left to goal) -- longer (10+ moves), risks row 8 col 2/4 # maze. Or row 11 col 3/4 up to row 10 col 3, up to row 9 col 3, right -- viable but 1 move longer. Failing approaches: Greedy rightward (hits # immediately); ignoring up (stuck bottom); no backtrack planning (traps waste moves). Generic strategies: (1) Map open corridors (row 9 highway). (2) Identify chokepoints (# barriers) and bypasses. (3) Estimate Manhattan distance (up 1 net, right 3; total ~4, but obstacles +2). (4) Mentally BFS/DFS short paths, flag dead ends early.

Other walls are peripheral: row 4 col 5 (upper middle), row 6 col 9 (upper right edge), row 12 col 3 (lower left). No walls block row 8 entirely, making it a clear horizontal path. General movement requires net +6 columns right and +1 row down from start.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Multiple paths exist due to open space, but efficiency favors minimal moves (Manhattan distance: 6 right + 1 down = 7 moves). Primary viable strategy: Traverse right along open row 8 to column 9, then down to goal—avoids all walls entirely.\n\nBlocked paths:\n- Direct down then right: From row 8 col 3 D to row 9 col 3 (open), then R to col 5 (open), but col 6 is #—cannot reach col 7-9 on row 9 without backtracking (dead end trap on row 9 left side).\n- Right to row 8 col 6+, down early to row 9 col 7/8/9: Possible (e.g., RRRRR D R or similar), but same or longer length.\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid:\n- Row 9 columns 1-5: Trapped by # at col 6; must go up/down to escape, wasting moves.\n- Row 6 col 9 #: Blocks upper right corner access.\n- Row 12 col 3 #: Traps if descending left side bottom.\n- Row 4 col 5 #: Minor upper obstacle, irrelevant here.\n- Out-of-bounds: Left from col 1 (L), right from col 9 (R), up from row 1 (U), down from row 12 (D)—all moves must check bounds.\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily right (net +6 columns), minor down (+1 row). Avoid left/up (wrong direction) or premature down (hits row 9 # trap).\n\nWhy certain approaches fail:\n- All-left/up: Increases distance, hits irrelevant walls or bounds.\n- Down-first: Hits row 9 col 6 # dead end (cannot cross horizontally).\n- Bottom looparound: D to row 10/11/12, right, up—works but 20+ moves (e.g., D D RRRRRR U U), inefficient.\n- Top looparound: U to row 1-7, right, down—longer, risks row 4/6 walls.\nBFS/DFS mentally: Shortest paths skirt row 8 right, drop at col 7-9. Chosen: Maximize row 8 usage for safety/openness.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: RRRRRR D (6 right along row 8 to col 9, then down). This stays on fully open row 8, bypasses row 9 col 6 # by approaching goal vertically from above.\n\n- Start: row 8, col 3\n- Move 1: R → row 8, col 4 (open -, no obstacles)\n- Move 2: R → row 8, col 5 (open -, navigated past potential upper wall influence but irrelevant)\n- Move 3: R → row 8, col 6 (open -, approaching row 9 # but staying above)\n- Move 4: R → row 8, col 7 (open -, now right of row 9 #)\n- Move 5: R → row 8, col 8 (open -, clear path to edge)\n- Move 6: R → row 8, col 9 (open -, right edge, avoids row 6 col 9 # above)\n- Move 7: D → row 9, col 9 (G, descends directly to goal, bypasses row 9 col 6 #)\n\nAlternate explored: RRRR D RR (to row 8 col 7, D to row 9 col 7 open, RR to col 9)—also 7 moves, but drops earlier into row 9 right section; chosen path safer as row 8 fully open.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace from start row 8 col 3:\n1. R → row 8 col 4 (-, bounds ok, no #)\n2. R → row 8 col 5 (-, bounds ok, row 4 col 5 # irrelevant)\n3. R → row 8 col 6 (-, bounds ok)\n4. R → row 8 col 7 (-, bounds ok, now right of row 9 col 6 #)\n5.

No walls hit (all positions - or G). All within 1-12 rows, 1-9 cols. No errors; path verified collision-free.

Early left to [1,1]# or [4,1]# dead. Bottom row left [5,1]# but avoidable.\n- General direction needed: Down 4 steps net, right 1 net (col4 to col5), but requires temporary right detour to col6 to bypass blocks.\n- Why certain approaches would fail:\n  - Greedy down-first: Hits [3,4] dead-end, wastes moves backtracking.\n  - Left-only: Works (e.g., descend col2-3, down row4 col2, right along row5) but 9+ moves, riskier narrow path.\n  - Right-straight: [1,4] R D D hits [3,5]#.\n  - No bounds check: e.g., R from col6 out-of-bounds invalid.\n- Generic reasoning strategies (extensible to other domains): 1) Parse grid into coordinates/list obstacles. 2) Identify chokepoints/blockages and flanking maneuvers (left/right bypass). 3) Spot fully open lanes (col6) for safe descent. 4) Simulate short detours vs long recoveries. 5) Prioritize BFS-like exploration mentally: breadth over depth to avoid deep dead-ends. 6) Verify alternates for robustness. 7) Minimize moves by combining directions efficiently.

Patterns: The grid is mostly open space with only two isolated walls. The upper wall at (3,3) is above the goal and could block paths going too far up before left. The lower wall at (9,6) is below the start and rightward, potentially trapping if moving down-right. Constraints: Cannot pass walls (#), cannot go out of bounds (rows 1-12, columns 1-7). Manhattan distance: 2 up + 3 left = 5 moves minimum. No narrow corridors or complex mazes, but bounds and walls require checking edges.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple possible paths exist due to open grid, e.g., go up first then left (UULLL), or left first then up (LLLUU), or mixed like ULULL. Both walls are off the direct path: (3,3) is irrelevant as goal is at row 5; (9,6) only affects bottom-right exploration. Dead ends/traps: Moving down from start increases row distance to goal (e.g., D to row 8 col 4, now 3 up + 3 left needed, but farther); right-down to (9,6) wall blocks, then stuck if continue right/down (out of bounds col 8 or row 10+ loops). Going up past row 5 to row 4/3 then left hits no wall directly but (3,3) blocks if aim there, wasting moves. General direction: Primarily up (net 2) and left (net 3), stay in left-upper quadrant. Failing approaches: Pure down/right fails (away from goal, hits wall/bounds); zigzagging excessively creates cycles (e.g., R L loops); ignoring bounds (L from col 1 or U from row 1 invalid); assuming walls block direct (they don't). Generic strategy: Compute Manhattan, prioritize reducing both row/col diffs; BFS mentally for shortest; avoid increasing distance; check obstacles in candidate directions; extensible to pathfinding (A* heuristic, obstacle avoidance, dead-end pruning).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: UULLL (up then left; efficient, avoids lower wall entirely).

Player starts at row 1, column 9 (@). Goal is at row 7, column 7 (G). Wall locations: (1,8), (5,10), (6,6), (8,3), (8,11), (10,5), (10,9). Patterns and constraints: The grid is mostly open with sparse walls. Key obstacles include a wall immediately left of the start at (1,8), blocking direct left movement; a wall at (5,10) partially blocking the right edge in mid-grid; a central lower wall at (6,6) that could obstruct paths aiming too far left before descending; and lower walls in row 8 and 10 that are avoidable since the goal is in row 7. No walls block column 7 from row 2 to row 7. Bounds prevent moving up from row 1 or outside columns 1-11. Manhattan distance is 6 down + 2 left = 8 moves minimum.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Need to move generally down (net +6 rows) and left (net -2 columns). Direct left from start fails due to wall at (1,8). Multiple paths exist: shortest require bypassing (1,8) by moving down first to row 2 (open), then left to column 7, then straight down column 7 (fully open from row 2-7). Alternate paths include delaying left moves (e.g., down to row 3 or 4 first, then left), going right to columns 10-11 then down and left (longer, ~10+ moves), or zigzagging around (6,6). Paths blocked: Any attempting left in row 1 (hits (1,8)); down column 10 from row 4 (hits (5,10)); through (6,6). Dead ends/traps: Right edge semi-blocked at (5,10), forcing detour left to column 9 or 11 to continue down—not a full dead end but inefficient; lower right at (8,11) avoidable. No true dead ends as grid percolates to goal. General direction: Down to row 2, left to column 7, down to row 7. Approaches that fail: Greedy left-first (wall); staying right/down without left correction (misses column 7); ignoring (6,6) if path veers left early (e.g., to column 5-6 down would need to skirt right). Generic strategies: Identify blocking obstacles and minimal detours (here, 1 down to bypass wall); verify clear vertical/horizontal corridors post-detour; explore alternates mentally via visualization or BFS-like expansion; prioritize Manhattan-optimal paths; check for chokepoints (e.g., (5,10), (6,6)) and viable bypasses (left/right); extensible to other domains like maze-solving (obstacle avoidance, path clearance checks) or planning (resource constraints, multi-step detours).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Minimal detour down then left, then straight down clear column 7.

All other cells are empty (-). Patterns and constraints: The goal is 2 rows up and 1 column right from start (Manhattan distance 3). Direct path upward is mostly open, but a wall at row 4 col 5 blocks rightward movement too early. Lower walls (rows 8-9) form potential traps or mazes irrelevant to the goal. No walls directly above start in col 4 (rows 4 and 3 col 4 are empty). Boundaries prevent moves outside 1-11 rows, 1-6 cols.

Paths blocked: Right then up (R from start to (5,5), U to (4,5)# wall). Up then right (U to (4,4), R to (4,5)# wall). Dead ends/traps: Going down from start leads to open rows 6-7, but row 8 has walls at col 2 and 6 narrowing passage; row 9 col 3 # creates a potential loop or block if trying to circle back up—unnecessary since goal is above. Going left from start (L to (5,3)) opens west but requires extra moves east later. General direction: Primarily up (net -2 rows), slight right (+1 col). BFS mentally prioritizes minimal moves: explore up first as it reduces row distance directly. Approaches that fail: Greedy right-first ignores local wall at (4,5); down-first increases distance without progress (extra up moves needed later, risking lower walls). Zigzag (e.g., L U R U) works but inefficient. Generic strategies: Model as graph (cells as nodes, valid adj moves as edges); BFS for shortest path avoids cycles; visualize obstacles between start-goal line; prune irrelevant areas (lower grid post-row 7).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: UUR (shortest, direct, avoids all obstacles).\n- Start: row 5, col 4.

Prioritize staying in central columns 2-5 to avoid walls.\n\nApproaches that fail:\n- Going through walls (e.g., UUUU to row 8 col 5, LLL to row 8 col 2, then try U to row 7 col 2: hits #).\n- Over-right: RRR UUUUUU hits (4,8) and requires backtrack.\n- Ignoring bounds: LLLLL from start goes out col 0.\n- Zigzag unnecessarily increases length.\n\nGeneric strategies: Mentally map obstacles relative to start/goal; compute Manhattan for baseline; enumerate 2-3 candidate paths (e.g., horizontal-then-vertical vs vertical-then-horizontal); check each segment for walls/bounds; identify dead ends by simulating forward; prefer central/open corridors; use subgoal breaking (e.g., 'reach row 9 first, then col 2'); backtrack mentally if blocked; extensible to larger grids via BFS/A* approximation or divide-conquer (clear rows/cols).\n\nChosen path: Left then up (LLLUUU) - stays left side, avoids all walls, minimal length.\nAlternate: Up then left (UUULLL) also works.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nStart: (12,5)\n- Move L → (12,4): Row 12 open.\n- Move L → (12,3): Open.\n- Move L → (12,2): Open, navigated left freely on bottom row.\n- Move U → (11,2): Row 11 fully open.\n- Move U → (10,2): Row 10 fully open.\n- Move U → (9,2): Row 9 col 2 is G, open path up column 2.\n\nAvoided: No need to cross row 7 col 2 # since arriving at row 9.\n\n# Verification\n\nTrace full solution L L L U U U:\n1.

U → (9,2): ok, row9 col2 G.\n\nEnd at (9,2). No walls hit, all in bounds (rows 9-12, cols 2-5). Path length 6, minimal. Alternates like UUULLL also verify similarly: (12,5)-U-(11,5)-U-(10,5)-U-(9,5)-L-(9,4)-L-(9,3)-L-(9,2), all open on row9 cols 2-5.

All other cells are empty (-). \n\nPatterns/constraints: The grid is almost entirely open with only two isolated walls in the upper-middle area (near columns 6-8, rows 2-3). No walls block the direct path from bottom-leftish start to upper-left goal. Key constraints: Cannot pass through # walls; must stay within row 1-8 and column 1-12 bounds. Manhattan distance is 5 up + 1 left = 6 moves minimum. Walls do not create chokepoints but could trap inefficient paths that veer right unnecessarily.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple possible paths: Yes, highly open grid allows many routes (e.g., go left first then up, or up first then left, or zigzag). Minimal paths are 6 moves.\n\nBlocked paths: Direct rightward paths risking walls, e.g., moving right to column 6+ then up could hit row 3 col 6 # or row 2 col 8 #.

No walls in column 1 (fully passable from row 1 to 9). Column 10 is fully passable downward. Walls create minor local blocks: vertical barrier at column 7 in rows 1-3 (prevents crossing left-right at top), isolated wall at row 4 col 4 (easy to skirt), and corner wall at row 5 col 12 (blocks downward in far right). Overall, Manhattan distance is 7 down + 9 left = 16 moves minimum.

Must backtrack left, wasting moves. Avoid rightward deviation.\n- Going up (U) to row 1: open at col 10, but row 1 col 7 # blocks crossing left fully; leads away from goal (downward needed).\n\nApproaches that fail and why:\n- Direct 'diagonal' (impossible; only cardinal moves).\n- Ignoring bounds: e.g., L 10 times from col 10 hits col 0 (invalid).\n- Greedy always-left-then-down works here but fails in mazes with barriers (e.g., if col 1 had wall, need detour right/down first).\n- No BFS needed here (open grid), but generic strategy: Use heuristic (min(row diff, col diff) towards goal), validate moves (bounds + no #), explore branches depth-first with backtracking, or breadth-first for shortest.\nChosen: Left-first (Path A) hugs left wall to goal column, then down.

All other cells are empty (- or G, which is passable).\n\nPatterns and constraints: The grid is mostly open, especially row 3 and row 4, which have no walls. Row 2 has a central wall at col 5, splitting it into left (cols 1-4) and right (cols 6-11) sections. Row 1 has a wall near the right at col 10, limiting leftward travel. Row 5 is segmented by walls at cols 2, 8, 11, creating potential dead ends or narrow passages. Bounds must be respected: cannot go above row 1, below row 5, left of col 1, or right of col 11. Pathfinding must avoid walls entirely and reach exactly (2,1). Generic strategy insight: Identify open corridors (e.g., fully empty rows) and barriers that require detours; model as graph where cells are nodes, edges are valid moves.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple possible paths exist due to open spaces in rows 3 and 4. Primary direction needed: net movement of 10 columns left and 1 row up. Optimal paths hug open rows like row 3.\n\nBlocked paths: Direct travel left on row 2 from right side hits wall at (2,5) after reaching (2,6), preventing access to (2,1)-(2,4). Row 1 from right: can reach (1,11), but wall at (1,10) blocks further left. Row 5: wall at (5,11) impassable; even if entering row 5 earlier, walls at (5,2) and (5,8) create segments—e.g., from right, can enter but hit barriers, risking dead ends.\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid: Lingering in row 5 right segment (cols 9-11 blocked rightward/outward); wall at (5,11) traps if trying down from (4,11). Row 2 right side is a cul-de-sac for leftward goal. Row 1 right is shallow dead end.\n\nApproaches that fail and why:\n- Up then left (U to (2,11), then L): Hits (2,5)# after 5L, no direct bypass without backtracking down/up, inefficient.\n- Up-up then left: Reaches (1,11), but L hits (1,10)# immediately; cannot traverse row 1 leftward.\n- Down to row 5 then left: From (4,11) cannot D to #; even entering leftward on row 5 hits (5,8)# or (5,2)#, requiring zigzags, longer and riskier.\n- Staying right edge: No path to left goal without left moves.\n\nBest strategy: Use fully open row 3 as highway left to col 1 (10L), then U to goal. Shorter alternatives exist (e.g., L some, D to row 4, L, U variations), but row 3 is simplest/no-risk. Generic extensible strategies: Prioritize widest open paths; simulate short paths first; identify chokepoints (walls splitting areas); use 'corridor following' or BFS-like mental search to avoid local traps; backtrack virtually on blocks.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Move left 10 times along row 3 (fully open corridor) to (3,1), avoiding all walls, then up to goal.

All other cells are empty (-), including the goal G which is passable.\n\nKey constraints: Moves only U/D/L/R, no diagonals; cannot pass walls or go out of bounds (rows/cols 1-7). Player cannot occupy walls.\n\nPatterns: Isolated walls at top-left and top-middle; a barrier cluster in row 4 columns 2-5 blocking vertical passage through the middle; sparse walls lower down. Player and goal are in the top-right open area (rows 1-3, cols 5-7 mostly clear). General constraint: the row 4 wall cluster forces detours if moving south, but irrelevant here since goal is north-west.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Goal is 1 row up and 1 column left from start, suggesting minimal moves (2 steps total). General direction: primarily up and left.\n\nMultiple paths: Shortest paths include UL (up then left) or LU (left then up), both length 2. Longer paths possible, e.g., LUL (left, up, left—but redundant), or circling around like LLL... then up, but unnecessary.\n\nBlocked paths: Direct right (R) from start hits column 8 (out of bounds). Down (D) to (4,7) is open, but leads toward row 4 wall cluster—e.g., from (4,7) left to (4,6) open, but further left hits walls at (4,5)-(4,2), creating a partial dead end if trying to loop south (must backtrack north). Up-up (UU) to (1,7) open but overshoots goal. Left along row 3 fully open to col 1, no blocks. Row 2 has wall at (2,4), so paths through col 4 blocked, but irrelevant for goal at col 6.\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid: Row 4 wall barrier traps if overcommitted south (e.g., D L L L from (4,7) hits # at (4,5)-(4,2), requiring backtrack). Bottom row 7 fully open but far detour. Wall at (2,4) blocks mid-row 2 east-west travel, but goal accessible from right side.\n\nApproaches that fail and why:\n- Going south first (D...): Adds distance, risks wall cluster; e.g., DDD hits row 6 col 7 open but distant, no progress toward goal.\n- Going left too far (LLLLLL): Reaches (3,1) open, but long detour; must navigate back right/up, inefficient.\n- Ignoring bounds: R from (3,7) or U from row 1 fails.\n- Assuming diagonals: Not allowed; must grid-adhere.\n\nGeneric strategies: Visualize/mentally map grid; identify Manhattan distance (here 2) as lower bound. Prioritize obstacle-free zones near start/goal. Simulate moves forward (BFS-like mentally: explore neighbors level-by-level). Avoid greedy traps (e.g., south looks open but dead-ends). Check validity per move: bounds + no wall. Explore alternates briefly for robustness, prefer shortest/cleanest.\n\nChosen solution: UL (direct, minimal).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nStart at (3,7).\n- Move U: From (3,7) up decreases row to (2,7). (2,7) is -, empty, no obstacle. Navigates around nothing—direct open path.\n- Move L: From (2,7) left decreases col to (2,6). (2,6) is G, passable goal, no obstacle. Avoids irrelevant walls elsewhere.\n\nAlternate path explored: LU—L from (3,7) to (3,6) (-, open), U to (2,6) G. Equally valid, same length. Longer like L U R L unnecessary.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace for UL:\n1. Start: (3,7) valid.\n2. U: row 3-1=2, col7 → (2,7). Bounds: row2 (1-7), col7 (1-7). Cell: row2 col7 is -, not #.

L → (3,6): row3 col6 -, valid.\n3. U → (2,6): G, valid.\nSame result.\n\nConfirm no invalid moves: No out-of-bounds (e.g., no extra R/U). No # traversed.

E.g., entering row 3 col 3 (empty) allows down but blocks left (wall at 3,1-2) and rightish (3,4), forcing detour south—wasteful for goal.\n- General direction: Primarily up and left; any right or down increases distance unnecessarily.\n- Failing approaches:\n  - Going down first (D to 2,2): Moves away from goal, requires ~4+ extra moves to loop back (e.g., D L D R U U L), inefficient and risks wall navigation errors.\n  - Going right (R to 1,3): Empty, but deviates; to reach goal needs leftward correction + up, longer (e.g., R L U = 3 moves).\n  - Ignoring bounds: Upright from start not possible as up-right would be (0,3) empty but not minimal.\n  - Wall-blind moves: Attempting up from blocked spots (none here) or through # fails.\n\nGeneric strategies extensible to other domains:\n- Model as graph: Cells as nodes, valid moves (U/D/L/R to empty/bounds-ok cells) as edges; shortest path via BFS/DFS.\n- Prioritize net displacement: Compute Manhattan distance (here |1-0| + |2-1| = 2), seek minimal moves matching it.\n- Scan local obstacles: Check 1-2 steps ahead; here top unobstructed.\n- Avoid backtracking: Explore greedily toward goal unless blocked.\n- Prune long detours: If path > Manhattan + obstacles, reconsider.\n- Visualize mentally: Sketch subgrids around player/goal/walls.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: UL (shortest, direct; LU equivalent).\n- Start: (1, 2)\n- Move U: Up decreases row to (0, 2).

Player starts at row 2, column 7 (@). Goal is at row 1, column 5 (G). There are no walls (#) anywhere on the grid—all cells are empty (-), making it a completely open field with no impassable obstacles. Key constraints: moves must stay within grid bounds (cannot go above row 1, below row 6, left of column 1, or right of column 7). Patterns: direct line-of-sight to goal with Manhattan distance of 3 steps (1 up, 2 left). No barriers, so shortest paths are efficient, but longer detours are possible if not careful.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: The grid is obstacle-free, so any path consisting of exactly 1 'U' and 2 'L's will reach the goal in the minimal 3 moves, regardless of order (permutations: LLU, LUL, ULL). Multiple possible paths exist, but all shortest ones are equivalent in length. No paths are blocked since there are no walls. Dead ends or traps: None exist due to openness, but potential risks include going out of bounds (e.g., 'R' from column 7 hits edge; 'U' from row 1 would be invalid but not attempted here) or unnecessary detours like 'D' (down) or extra 'R's, which increase path length without benefit and could lead to inefficient looping if not corrected. General direction needed: Primarily up (decrease row by 1) and left (decrease column by 2). Approaches that would fail: (1) Moves increasing distance (e.g., 'D' to row 3 wastes steps, requiring correction later); (2) Out-of-bounds moves (e.g., 'RR' from start overshoots right edge); (3) Ignoring bounds checking (e.g., repeated 'L's from column 1). Generic strategy: Compute deltas (Δrow = -1, Δcol = -2), generate minimal move sequences matching deltas, prioritize staying in bounds and minimizing extras. This extensible to pathfinding: use Manhattan distance for heuristics, enumerate short sequences, prune invalid/out-of-bounds. In obstructed grids, extend to BFS avoiding walls.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: LLU (one of minimal shortest paths; others like ULL also work). \n- Current position: row 2, col 7.

Going right-up blocked by row 6 cols 8-9 ## and row 5/7 col 9 #, forcing wide left detour around col 10-11 open corridor.\n\nDead ends/traps: Right side (cols 10-11) is a narrow corridor up to row 1, but to reach goal requires crossing back left, past row 6 col 6 # and col 9 #, risking loops. Bottom-left (row 8 cols 1-4) open but overshoot requires backtrack. Avoid by checking local obstacles first.\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily left (west) 3 columns, same row; minimal up/down needed. Failing approaches: BFS/DFS without pruning leads to long paths (e.g., explore right/up first: 10+ moves). Greedy right/up fails due to wall traps. Direct line-of-sight check succeeds here. Generic strategy: (1) Check direct path (Manhattan: 3 left). (2) If blocked, identify block type (single wall vs maze). (3) Explore neighbors, prioritize goal direction. (4) Avoid backtracking traps by mental bounding box. (5) Verify bounds/obstacles per move. Extensible: Applies to grid pathfinding (A*, BFS), games (avoid chokepoints), real-world routing (prioritize highways over alleys).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Direct left along row 8 (shortest, no obstacles).\n- Start: (8,8)\n- Move L: To (8,7) [empty -], navigates open space toward goal.\n- Move L: To (8,6) [empty -], continues direct path.\n- Move L: To (8,5) [goal G], arrives.\n\nAlternate explored (for learning): Up then left-down: U to (7,8)-, LLLL to (7,4)-, D to (8,4)-, R to (8,5)G (6 moves, unnecessary).

Player starts at row 9, column 3 (position marked '@'). Goal is at row 11, column 4 (marked 'G'). Walls ('#') are impassable and located at:\n- Row 1: columns 1, 4\n- Row 2: columns 2, 5\n- Row 3: column 2\n- Row 5: column 4\n- Row 7: column 2\n- Row 8: column 6\n- Row 9: column 7\n- Row 11: column 1\n\nAll other cells are empty ('-') or the goal/player. Key constraints: moves must stay within row 1-11, column 1-8; cannot pass through '#'; up decreases row number, down increases it, left decreases column, right increases it. Patterns: the bottom rows (9-11) are mostly open with minor walls (row 9 col 7 #, row 11 col 1 #), forming a clear corridor to the goal. Upper rows have more scattered walls creating potential mazes or blocks, but the goal is directly below the start, suggesting a downward focus. No diagonal moves; only orthogonal (U/D/L/R).\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nThe general direction needed is down (2 rows) and slightly right (1 column net), for a Manhattan distance of 3 moves. Multiple short paths exist in the open bottom area, e.g., DRD or RDD, both length 3. Longer detours (e.g., left then right) are possible but inefficient.\n\nBlocked paths: Direct right along row 9 hits # at col 7 (cannot RRRRRR). Upper navigation blocked by walls like row 8 col 6 # and row 7 col 2 #, creating chokepoints. To reach goal from above row 9 requires navigating around these, but unnecessary.\n\nDead ends/traps: \n- Row 9 col 7 # traps if over-right (e.g., RRRR from start hits wall at col 7).\n- Row 11 col 1 # blocks extreme left access to goal.\n- Upper dead ends: e.g., row 1 col 1 # and row 2 col 2/5 # create cul-de-sacs if wandering up-left.\n\nApproaches that fail:\n- Going primarily up/left: moves away from goal, risks walls (e.g., U from start to row 8 col 3 open, but UU to row 7 col 3 open, UUU to row 6 col 3 open, but further up hits denser walls; looping back adds length unnecessarily).\n- Over-right then down: R to col 6 row 9 open, but RR to col 5, etc., but RRRR hits col 7 #.\n- Ignoring bounds: e.g., LLLL from row 10 col 4 goes to col 0 (invalid).\n\nGeneric strategies: Use coordinate tracking for precision. Mentally simulate BFS (breadth-first search) from start, prioritizing shortest paths by exploring neighbors level-by-level. Visualize grid quadrants: bottom-right open, avoid upper mazes. Prune by distance: discard paths going opposite goal direction. Check local obstacles before committing moves. Test alternates: simulate 2-3 paths to confirm viability. Extensible to other domains: decompose into state (position), actions (moves), constraints (walls/bounds); use lookahead to avoid dead ends; prefer greedy toward goal with backtracking.\n\nChosen path: DRD (down-right-down), direct and avoids all issues. Alternate RDD equally valid.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nStart at (9,3).\n- Move D: From (9,3) down to (10,3). Row 10 col 3 is '-', open; navigates open bottom corridor, no obstacles.\n- Move R: From (10,3) right to (10,4). Row 10 col 4 is '-', open; slight right adjustment toward goal column.\n- Move D: From (10,4) down to (11,4). Row 11 col 4 is 'G', reachable; final descent, avoids row 11 col 1 # by correct column.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace:\n- Start: (9,3), open.\n- 1st D: to (10,3) -- row 10: all '-', no wall, row 10 <=11, col 3 in 1-8.\n- 2nd R: to (10,4) -- row 10 col 4 '-', no wall, col 4 in 1-8.\n- 3rd D: to (11,4) -- row 11 col 4 'G', no wall, row 11 <=11, col 4 in 1-8.\n\nEnd exactly at goal.

Column 2 is completely open from row 1 to row 9 (all '-' or start/goal). Other columns have sporadic walls creating potential blocks. Must stay within bounds (rows 1-12, cols 1-4). No diagonal moves. Net movement needed: +8 rows down, 0 columns horizontal. Total minimum moves: 8 (pure down). Walls near goal (row 9 cols 1 and 4) limit side access but allow direct entry from above/below/specific sides.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Direct path down column 2 works perfectly (8 downs), as no walls block it—shortest and simplest. Multiple paths exist via zigzags (e.g., right to col 3, down, left to goal), but all longer or equal. Paths blocked: Cannot enter row 1 col 4 (#), row 5 col 1 (#) blocks col 1 descent, row 7 col 4 (#) blocks col 4 mid-way, row 9 cols 1/4 (#) prevent left/right entry to goal from those sides, row 11 cols 1/2 (#) create a bottom dead zone.\n\nDead ends/traps: Col 1 down to row 4, then stuck (cannot go down row 5 col 1); must backtrack right. Col 4 early block at row 1/7. Bottom area (row 11 cols 1-2 blocked, row 12 open) is a detour trap—going there adds unnecessary moves/uphill return. General direction: Primarily down (net +8 rows); minor left/right for exploration but avoid extremes.\n\nWhy certain approaches fail:\n- Pure left (col 1): Hits row 5 col 1 #, dead end requiring backtrack (wastes moves).\n- Pure right (col 4): Immediate row 1 col 4 # or later row 7 col 4 #.\n- Bottom loop (to row 12 then up): Far longer (20+ moves), risks row 11 blocks.\n- Side-to-goal at row 9: Possible from col 3 (open), but requires horizontal detour.\nGeneric strategies: Check direct line first (column 2 open—success). If blocked, BFS/explore neighbors level-by-level for shortest path. Visualize column openness. Avoid greedily following open spaces into dead ends (e.g., col 1). Prune by Manhattan distance (down 8, left/right 0).

Player starts at row 2, column 4 (@). Goal at row 8, column 1 (G). Wall locations: row 1 column 1 (#), row 4 column 4 (#), row 6 column 5 (#). All other cells are empty (-). Patterns/constraints: The grid is mostly open with only three walls, sparsely placed. Key constraints include impassable walls, staying within bounds (rows 1-11, columns 1-5), and no diagonal moves. The walls create local blockages: the wall at row 4 col 4 blocks direct downward movement in column 4; row 1 col 1 blocks top-left corner; row 6 col 5 blocks bottom-right descent in column 5. Manhattan distance is 6 down + 3 left = 9 moves, suggesting shortest paths around 9 steps.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple possible paths exist due to the open grid. Primary viable strategy: move left to column 1 early (avoiding the row 4 col 4 wall), then descend straight down to the goal, as column 1 is completely clear from row 2 to row 8. Alternative paths include descending first to row 3 col 4, then left to col 3, down to row 4 col 3 (bypassing row 4 col 4 wall), and continuing left/downward adjustments—this works but is longer (e.g., ~11 moves). Paths blocked: Direct down from start (row 2 col 4 → row 3 col 4 → row 4 col 4 hits #). Staying in column 5 down from row 2: row 2 col 5 → row 3 col 5 → row 4 col 5 → row 5 col 5 → row 6 col 5 hits #, creating a partial dead end (must backtrack left). Dead ends/traps to avoid: Overcommitting rightward into column 5 before row 6 (blocked at row 6 col 5, forcing left detour); going up to row 1 (unnecessary detour, limited by row 1 col 1 # and top bound). General direction: Primarily down (net +6 rows) and left (net -3 columns). Approaches that fail: Greedy straight down (hits row 4 col 4 #); staying right/down (trapped by row 6 col 5 #, inefficient); up-first (increases distance, no benefit). Generic strategy: Identify direct path obstacles (e.g., scan column for walls), prioritize detour to open columns (here, left to col 1), consider bounds/dead ends via mental simulation, prefer Manhattan-optimal by minimizing extras.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Move left 3 times to column 1 at row 2 (clear path: row 2 cols 3,2,1 all empty), then down 6 times (column 1 rows 3-8 all empty, reaches G).

Patterns/constraints: Mostly open grid, but key chokepoints at row 6 (blocks col 2 and 5, forcing passage through col 3 or 4) and row 10 (block at col 3 splits row 10 into left (col 1-2) and right (col 4-5) sections, impassable horizontally across the wall). Overall, need net +8 rows down and +3 columns right. No upper bounds issues (row 1 open), lower rows (11-12) mostly open but irrelevant for direct path.

Multiple paths exist via central columns (3-4), but peripherals risky. Blocked paths: Staying in col 2 hits row 6 col 2 wall; col 5 blocked early by row 3 col 5 and row 6 col 5. Dead ends/traps: (1) Left side (col 1-2 down to row 10) traps player left of row 10 col 3 wall—cannot cross to col 4-5 on row 10 without detour (e.g., down to row 11, right across open row, up), adding moves. (2) Arriving at row 10 col 3 directly hits wall. (3) Premature right to col 5 before row 6 blocked. Viable strategy: Move down in col 2 initially (open until row 5), shift right to col 3-4 before row 6 chokepoint, stay in col 4 down to row 10 (avoids row 10 col 3), final right to goal. Alternate: Shift right earlier (e.g., col 3 from start), down to row 9 col 3, right to col 4, down then right—same length. Failing approaches: Greedy down-only fails at row 6 col 2; greedy right-first to col 5 fails at row 3/6 col 5; left exploration leads to dead end without backtrack planning. Generic strategy: Identify chokepoints/obstacles ahead, compute net displacement, test column viability per row section, prune dead ends by checking connectivity to goal (e.g., row 10 split), prefer central safe paths; extensible to mazes via divide-conquer (segment by barriers), or search algorithms like BFS for optimality.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen path prioritizes early down in safe col 2, timely right shift around row 6 walls, col 4 descent to skirt row 10 wall.

Key constraints: Moves must stay within bounds (rows 1-4, columns 1-8); cannot go out of bounds or onto walls (none present). Patterns: Completely open grid with no obstacles, allowing free movement in four directions (U, D, L, R). The primary constraint is the Manhattan distance: 3 rows down and 2 columns right, for a minimum of 5 moves. No patterns like chokepoints or barriers; movement is unrestricted horizontally or vertically.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Since the grid is fully open, any path consisting of exactly 3 'D' (down) moves and 2 'R' (right) moves will reach the goal, as long as intermediate positions stay within bounds. Multiple possible paths exist (e.g., all downs first then rights: DDDRR; all rights first then downs: RRDDD; interleaved like DRDRD).

Paths blocked: None by walls, but invalid moves include going U from row 1 (out of bounds top), L from column 1 (out left), R from column 8 (out right), D from row 4 (out bottom). Dead ends or traps: None exist due to openness; no loops or blocked areas to trap the player. Even detours (extra moves like L then R) are recoverable by backtracking, but inefficient. General direction needed: Primarily down (net +3 rows) and right (net +2 columns); left or up would require compensatory moves, lengthening the path. Approaches that would NOT work and why: (1) Going up (U) first: Immediately out of bounds from row 1, invalid. (2) Excessive left moves (e.g., LLLLL): Hits left bound at col1, then further L out of bounds; requires extra R to recover, making path longer than necessary. (3) Only horizontal moves (RRRR...): Stays in row 1, never reaches row 4. (4) Only vertical (DDD): Reaches row 4 col 5, misses col 7 goal. (5) Random walks without net progress: Inefficient, risks bounds violations if not careful. Optimal strategy: Choose a shortest path like RRDDD (rights first to align column, then downs), as it avoids any potential bound issues early (stays away from left edge) and is simple.

Or go down to (5,1), right to (5,2), up/down loops unnecessarily.\nBlocked paths: Any attempt to move right from start hits wall at (4,2). Moving left from col 1 goes out of bounds. Staying in row 4 and trying to loop around wall requires going left (impossible) or up then around, which is inefficient.\nDead ends or traps: No true dead ends due to open grid, but potential traps include going up into the large empty top area (rows 1-3), which would require extra moves to return down, wasting steps. Bottom rows (6-7) are open but away from goal. Avoid backtracking or circling the wall unnecessarily.\nGeneral direction: Primarily down (to match goal row) and right (to match goal column), prioritizing bypassing the adjacent wall by moving down first.\nWhy certain approaches fail:\n- 'RR' then down: First R hits wall.\n- 'R D R': First R invalid.\n- 'U R R D': Works but longer (4 moves), teaches inefficiency of detours.\n- Boundary hugging left/down-left: Out of bounds or away from goal.\nGeneric strategies: Visualize grid mentally; compute Manhattan distance for lower bound; identify local obstacles and bypass options (e.g., go around via adjacent row); prioritize shortest paths but verify feasibility; explore alternatives systematically (like BFS: check neighbors level-by-level) to avoid dead ends in more complex mazes; consider bounds as virtual walls.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: DRR (shortest, direct bypass).\n- Start: row 4, col 1.\n  Direction: D (down).\n  New position: row 5, col 1 (empty -, no obstacle).\n  Navigates around wall by dropping to row 5 first.\n- Current: row 5, col 1.\n  Direction: R (right).\n  New position: row 5, col 2 (empty -, open path to goal).\n  Moves toward goal column.\n- Current: row 5, col 2.\n  Direction: R (right).\n  New position: row 5, col 3 (G, goal reached).\n  No obstacles; direct hit.\n\nAlternate explored (for learning): URRDD (up to row 3 col 1, R to row 3 col 2, R to row 3 col 3, D to row 4 col 3, D to row 5 col 3). Avoided because longer; demonstrates detour cost.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace of DRR:\n1. Start: (4,1)\n2. D → (5,1): Within bounds (row 5 valid), cell is -, no wall.\n3. R → (5,2): Col 2 <=5, cell -, no wall.\n4. R → (5,3): Col 3 <=5, cell G, no wall.\nEnd: Exactly (5,3). Total moves: 3. No out-of-bounds (cols 1-3, rows 4-5 all valid).

Player starts at row 4, column 3 (@). Goal at row 2, column 2 (G). Wall locations: single wall (#) at row 5, column 7. All other cells are empty (-).\n\nPatterns and constraints: The grid is almost entirely open with only one wall in the bottom-right corner, which does not obstruct the direct path to the goal. The player must stay within bounds (rows 1-7, columns 1-7); moves outside bounds are invalid. No other impassable cells. Manhattan distance: |4-2| + |3-2| = 2 up + 1 left = 3 moves minimum. Direct line-of-sight path exists northwest (up and left).\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Multiple paths exist due to open grid (e.g., LUU, UUL, ULLU, etc., all length 3 or longer). Shortest paths are 3 moves: combinations of 2 U and 1 L in any order, as long as bounds and the single wall are avoided (wall irrelevant here).\n\nBlocked paths: No direct blocks to goal, but attempting to pass through (5,7) is impossible. Paths going down (D) or far right (R to col7 then D) lead away from goal.\n\nDead ends/traps: Bottom-right corner—e.g., RRRR to (4,7), then D hits # at (5,7), forcing backtrack (wasteful, not trapped but inefficient). Bottom rows (6-7) or right edge (col7 rows1-4,6-7) are accessible but dead ends for goal-reaching without backtracking, as they increase distance. Left edge (col1) or top (row1) reachable but overshooting requires correction.\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily up (net 2 rows) and left (net 1 column). Prioritize up/left moves; delay down/right.\n\nApproaches that fail:\n- Going down first (e.g., D): Increases row distance (to 3+), no benefit, potential to hit wall if also right.\n- Going right extensively (e.g., RRRRDR): Hits wall or loops far away.\n- Ignoring bounds (e.g., LLL from start: col3-3=0 invalid).\n- BFS/DFS mentally: Explore neighbors level-by-level; here, level 1: U(3,3), D(5,3), L(4,2), R(4,4)—discard D/R as increase distance.\nGeneric strategies: Compute Manhattan heuristic for guidance. Check each move for validity (bounds, no #). Prefer moves reducing heuristic. Explore branches briefly to confirm no shorter/better. Avoid expanding away-directions first. Transferable: In mazes, mark visited to prevent cycles; here minimal need.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: LUU (direct left then up; reduces col first, then row—avoids any hypothetical top-left issues, though none here).\n- Current: (4,3). Move L. New: (4,2). Navigated: Straight left, empty cell.\n- Current: (4,2). Move U. New: (3,2). Navigated: Up, empty (row3 all open).\n- Current: (3,2). Move U. New: (2,2). Navigated: Up to goal, empty/G cell.\n\nAlternate explored: UUL—(4,3)U>(3,3) empty; U>(2,3) empty; L>(2,2). Equally valid. LLUU longer (overshoots left to col1, back R). D-first fails strategically (e.g., D to (5,3), then need UUU L, total 5 moves, inefficient).\n\n# Verification\n\nStart: (4,3)\n1. L → (4,2): Col 3-1=2 (valid 1-7), row4 col2 empty (-), no #.\n2.

Player starts at row 8, column 6 (@). Goal is at row 4, column 6 (G). Wall locations: one wall at row 4, column 4 (#); another at row 5, column 8 (#). All other cells are empty (-). \n\nKey patterns and constraints: The grid is mostly open space with no walls in column 6 from row 8 to row 4, allowing direct vertical movement upward. Walls are positioned off the direct path: the wall at (4,4) blocks leftward approaches near the goal in row 4, and the wall at (5,8) blocks rightward movement in row 5 column 8. No other obstacles. Bounds are strict: rows 1-8, columns 1-12; moves must not go out of bounds. Primary constraint is avoiding the two # cells; no diagonal moves, only U/D/L/R.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: The shortest path is direct upward (4 steps up, same column), as column 6 is completely clear from row 8 to row 4. Distance: Manhattan distance is 4 units up (row 8 to 4), no left/right needed.\n\nMultiple possible paths: Yes, many detours exist, e.g., go left to column 5, up 4, right to column 6 (adds 2 extra moves); or right to column 7, up 4, left (also +2). Longer loops possible by going down first (but down from row 8 out of bounds, invalid). Paths around walls: Wall at (4,4) blocks any path trying to approach goal from left in row 4 column 4, but can go via (4,5) or (4,7). Wall at (5,8) blocks crossing right in row 5.\n\nBlocked paths: Direct left from goal area hits (4,4); trying to go right-up-up-up-right into (5,8) blocked. No full blockages to goal.\n\nDead ends or traps: Minimal; open grid means few dead ends. Potential trap: wandering left near row 4 into (4,4) wall, requiring backtrack. Going too far right in row 5 hits (5,8), dead end locally but escapable. Bottom row 8 has no walls but down move out of bounds (invalid). Top rows open but irrelevant.\n\nGeneral direction needed: Primarily up 4 net steps (decrease row by 4), stay near column 6. Avoid unnecessary left/right.\n\nApproaches that would NOT work and why:\n- Going down first: From (8,6), D moves to row 9, out of bounds (invalid).\n- Going left 3+ then up: Hits (4,4) if trying row4 col4; must detour right after.\n- Going right to col8 row5: Hits wall at (5,8), cannot pass, forces backtrack (wastes moves).\n- Staying in row8 and moving horizontally far: No progress toward goal, inefficient, risks bounds.\n- BFS/DFS mental simulation favors direct up as shortest; greedy up works here due to no obstacles in path.\n\nOptimal strategy: Direct UUUU, shortest (4 moves), no backtracking. Alternatives longer (6+ moves).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Direct upward path, as column 6 clear.\n\n1. Current: (8,6). Move U. New: (7,6).

All other cells are empty (-). \n\nKey patterns/constraints: The grid is mostly open with only two isolated walls. The upper wall at (2,9) blocks movement rightward from row 1/2 near column 9 but does not impede paths to the goal in the lower-left. The lower wall at (9,6) is far from the goal and irrelevant for short paths. Manhattan distance: |4-1| + |2-8| = 3 down + 6 left = 9 moves minimum. No narrow corridors or multi-wall barriers; high connectivity suggests many valid paths exist. Bounds must be respected (cannot go above row 1, below row 9, left of col 1, right of col 12).\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Primary direction needed is left (net -6 columns) and down (net +3 rows). Multiple paths possible due to open space: e.g., all left then all down (LLLLLLDDD), all down then all left (DDDLLLLLL), or interleaved (e.g., LLLDDDLLL). Shortest paths are any combination totaling 6L + 3D in any order, as no obstacles block the 1-4 row, 2-8 column rectangle.\n\nBlocked paths: Going right from start hits wall at (2,9) if descending immediately (e.g., R D from (1,8) to (1,9)-(2,9) blocked). Excessive rightward movement requires backtracking, lengthening path. Bottom wall blocks (9,6), so paths looping to row 9 column 6 dead-end there but can escape upward/left/right.\n\nDead ends/traps: Minimal; no true dead ends as grid allows circumvention. Pseudo-traps: lingering in top-right (cols 9-12, rows 1-2) delays progress; bottom row near col6 requires detour. Avoid by prioritizing left/down.\n\nFailed approaches: Pure right/up (wrong direction, hits bounds/wall). Down-first to row 9 then left (hits bottom wall if at col6, unnecessary detour). BFS mentally: explore level-by-level from start, prune wall/bounds. A* with Manhattan heuristic efficient here. Greedy (always toward goal) works: left/down priority succeeds. Random walks inefficient but viable long-term.\n\nChosen strategy: Left-first to column 2 (row 1 clear), then down to goal (column 2 rows 2-4 clear).

Player starts at row 1, column 8 (@). Goal is at row 3, column 7 (G). \n\nWall locations (#, impassable):\n- Row 1: columns 3, 6\n- Row 6: columns 5, 10\n- Row 7: column 8\n- Row 9: columns 4, 7, 11\n- Row 12: column 11\n\nAll other cells are empty (-). \n\nPatterns and constraints: The top section (rows 1-5) is mostly open with only two walls in row 1 (cols 3 and 6), which are not obstructing the direct path to the goal. The goal is nearby (Manhattan distance: |3-1| + |7-8| = 2 down + 1 left = 3 moves minimum). Lower rows (6+) have clustered walls forming potential barriers and dead ends (e.g., row 7 col 8 blocks vertical passage there, row 9 has multiple walls). Moves must stay within bounds (rows 1-12, cols 1-11); no diagonal moves; cannot pass walls. Generic constraint: pathfinding requires checking intermediate cells for validity.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Primary direction is down (increase row by 2) and left (decrease column by 1), minimal 3 moves. Multiple shortest paths exist (exactly two 'D' and one 'L' in any order, as long as intermediates are valid). All three permutations work: LDD, DDL, DLD.\n\nBlocked paths: Direct straight down then left is open. No blocks in top rows cols 7-8. Walls in row 1 cols 3/6 block far left but irrelevant. Lower walls irrelevant for this goal.\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid: Going too far down (e.g., from col 8: row 7 col 8 is #, so DDDDDD from start hits wall at row 7 col 8). Row 9 cols 4/7/11 create pockets (e.g., can't pass col 7 row 9). Row 12 col 11 is a corner trap. Rightward (R) leads to open but longer detours (need extra L later). Up (U) from row 1: out of bounds.\n\nGeneral direction: Prioritize down to reach row 3 quickly, minor left adjustment. \n\nApproaches that fail and why:\n- Going left too far (LL from start: (1,8)->(1,7)->(1,6)# invalid).\n- Ignoring bounds: U from row 1 fails.\n- Overcommitting down into lower maze (e.g., reach row 6 col 8 open, but row 7 col 8 # traps vertically).\n- Random moves or greedily right/up: increases distance, risks dead ends.\n\nGeneric strategies (extensible to other domains): 1) Compute Manhattan distance for lower bound. 2) Check straight-line paths (row-major or col-major) for obstacles. 3) Enumerate short paths near minimal length. 4) Lookahead 1-2 moves to avoid immediate dead ends. 5) Divide grid into safe zones (top open vs. bottom walled). 6) BFS mental simulation for shortest path (queue positions by distance). 7) Backtrack only if dead end, prefer forward progress toward goal coordinates. 8) Visualize/annotate grid mentally. These transfer to mazes, graphs, planning: prioritize goal-aligned moves, prune invalid early.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: 'DDL' (one minimal path; others like 'LDD' or 'DLD' also valid). Selected for direct vertical progress first.\n\n- Current position: row 1, col 8\n- Move D (down): new position row 2, col 8 (row 2 all empty, no obstacle).\n- Current position: row 2, col 8\n- Move D (down): new position row 3, col 8 (row 3 col 8 is '-', after G; no obstacle).\n- Current position: row 3, col 8\n- Move L (left): new position row 3, col 7 (G; navigates around no obstacles, direct to goal).\n\nAlternate paths explored: 'LDD' - L to (1,7) empty, D (2,7), D (3,7). Valid. 'DLD' - D (2,8), L (2,7), D (3,7). Valid. Longer paths (e.g., DRDL) work but inefficient.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace of 'DDL':\n- Start: row 1, col 8 (empty under @).\n- Move 1: D → row 2, col 8: row 2 is all '-', bounds 1-12/1-11 ok, not #.\n- Move 2: D → row 3, col 8: row 3 '------G----' (col 7=G, col 8='-', col 9-11='-'), ok, not #.\n- Move 3: L → row 3, col 7: G, ok, not #, within col 1-11.\n\nEnd: row 3, col 7 exactly. Total moves: 3. No walls hit, no out-of-bounds, no errors. Verified alternates similarly valid.

The key obstacle is the wall at (5,2), which blocks upward movement in column 2 from rows 6 and below. Other walls are isolated: (7,5) and (8,6) limit right-side movement near the start, and bottom walls in row 12 block column 2-4 but are irrelevant for upward paths. No walls block columns 1 or 3 upward from the start. Bounds must be respected (no row 0 or 13, no col 0 or 7). Net movement needed: 4 steps up (row 7 to 3), 1 step left (col 3 to 2).\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Multiple paths exist due to open space. Optimal paths prioritize upward progress while detouring the (5,2) wall.\n- Possible paths: (1) Up column 3 to row 3, then left to goal (direct, shortest). (2) Left to column 2 early, then detour left to column 1, up past wall, right to goal (longer). (3) Right to column 4+, up, then left (possible but inefficient). (4) Downward detours (e.g., row 8+ then loop up) work but are much longer and risk bottom walls.\n- Blocked paths: Any attempt to traverse column 2 upward before row 5 hits (5,2) # (e.g., from (6,2) up to (5,2) impossible). Right-side blocks at (7,5)/(8,6) prevent tight right loops near start.\n- Dead ends/traps: No true dead ends (grid open enough to backtrack), but pseudo-traps like entering column 2 below row 5 forces detour (wasted moves). Bottom row 12 walls could trap if going down excessively, but avoidable.\n- General direction: Primarily up (net -4 rows), minor left (-1 col). Stay in columns 1-4 to avoid right walls.\n- Failed approaches: (1) 'UULUU' -> (7,3)U(6,3)U(5,3)L(5,2)# invalid (hits wall). (2) 'LUU...' -> (7,3)L(7,2)U(6,2)U(5,2)# invalid. (3) Overly left to col1 without need -> longer path, e.g., 'LUUUUR' (6 moves vs 5). (4) Down first (e.g., 'DR...') moves away from goal, requires compensation. BFS/DFS mentally favors column 3 up then left as shortest/easiest.\nGeneric strategies: Identify local obstacles (like (5,2)) and bypass by adjacent columns. Prioritize net direction (up/left). Explore alternates by simulating 1-2 moves ahead. Avoid backtracking by checking forward blocks. Extensible: In mazes, use 'right-hand rule' or A* heuristics (Manhattan distance: |Δrow| + |Δcol| = 5 here); test greedy (move toward goal if open) vs detours.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: UUUUL (up column 3 past wall level, then left at goal row).\n- Start: (7,3)\n- U -> (6,3): Row 6 col 3 is -, open; progresses up.\n- U -> (5,3): Row 5 col 3 is -, open; navigates right of (5,2) wall.\n- U -> (4,3): Row 4 col 3 is -, open; continues up in safe column.\n- U -> (3,3): Row 3 col 3 is -, open; reaches goal row.\n- L -> (3,2): Row 3 col 2 is G, destination; left from adjacent open cell.\nThis avoids all walls by staying in column 3 until safe to left.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace:\n0.

Player starts at row 3, column 7 (@). Goal is at row 3, column 4 (G). There are no walls (#) anywhere on the grid—all cells are empty (-). This makes it a completely open space with no impassable obstacles.\n\nKey patterns and constraints:\n- Fully traversable grid, allowing free movement in all four directions (U, D, L, R) as long as within bounds (rows 1-4, columns 1-9).\n- Player and goal are on the same row (row 3), separated by 3 columns to the left (columns 7 to 4).\n- No patterns of walls or clusters, but bounds act as implicit barriers: cannot go above row 1 (U from row 1 invalid), below row 4 (D from row 4 invalid), left of column 1 (L from column 1 invalid), or right of column 9 (R from column 9 invalid).\n- Shortest path distance: 3 moves left (Manhattan distance = |7-4| + |3-3| = 3). Any detour increases length.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations:\n- Multiple possible paths: Infinite in theory (can loop), but optimal is direct left (LLL). Detours like going up/down/right then compensating are longer (e.g., U LLL D = 5 moves).\n- No blocked paths or walls, so no paths are inherently blocked.\n- Dead ends or traps: None exist due to open grid. However, bounds can create 'soft dead ends'—e.g., moving left to column 1 then unable to go further left requires backtracking (R). Moving right to column 9 or up/down to edges similarly traps progress temporarily.\n- General direction needed: Primarily left (net 3 left moves), staying on or near row 3 to minimize up/down compensation. No net vertical movement required.\n- Why certain approaches would fail:\n  - Going right (R): Moves away from goal (increases column distance), requiring later left moves to compensate—wastes steps (e.g., R LLLL = 5 moves vs. 3).\n  - Excessive up/down: E.g., UU then down—hits row 1 bound quickly (only 2 U possible from row 3), then must D back, adding pairs of wasted moves.\n  - Bound violations: From start, LLL fine, but if detoured to col1 then L: out of bounds, invalid.\n  - Random wandering: In larger grids with walls, this fails; here it works but inefficient. Generic strategy: Prefer greedy (direct toward goal) or BFS for shortest path.\n\nExtensible strategies:\n- Compute Manhattan distance for lower bound on moves.\n- In walled grids, use A* or BFS to avoid dead ends; here, simplifies to direct line.\n- Prioritize horizontal/vertical alignment first.\n- Avoid backtracking unless necessary; explore alternatives mentally before committing.\n\nChosen strategy: Direct left (LLL)—shortest, no risks.\nAlternate paths explored:\n- Go up to row 2, left 3, down to row 3: U LLL D (5 moves)—works but longer.\n- Go left to col4 via row 4: D LLL U (5 moves)—works.\n- Loop right then left: RRR LLLL (7 moves)—works but inefficient.\n- Risky: Go left to col1, then must navigate back—leads to longer paths.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: LLL (direct path).\n- Start: row 3, col 7.\n  - Move L: Navigate left, no obstacles.

All other cells are empty (-).\n\nPatterns and constraints: The grid is almost entirely open space with only two isolated walls on the upper left side. Player and goal are both on the top row (row 1), with the player to the right of the goal. Direct horizontal movement leftward on row 1 is possible between columns 10 to 7, as cells at (1,9), (1,8), and (1,7) are all passable (two empty, one goal). The wall at (1,4) blocks row 1 further left (columns 3 and below), but this does not affect reaching column 7.

Paths blocked: Cannot pass walls—e.g., on row 1, cannot go left beyond column 4 to column 3 or leftward; on row 2, cannot pass column 5. Dead ends/traps: None severe, as grid is open downward and rightward, but going left on row 1 past column 7 toward column 4 hits wall at (1,4), stranding if no down/up available (though down is possible). Going right from start leads away from goal, wasting steps. General direction: Primarily left (net -3 columns), same row (net 0 vertical). BFS/DFS mentally: shortest is horizontal.\n\nApproaches that would NOT work and why:\n- Going right (R): Increases column distance, no benefit, loops back longer.\n- Going down first (D): To (2,10), then left/up needed, but adds 2 extra vertical moves minimum (e.g., DLLLLLU = 7 steps vs 3), inefficient.\n- Going up (U): Out of bounds (row 0 invalid).\n- Over-left on row 1 (e.g., LLLLLL): Hits wall at (1,4) after passing goal, but cannot enter wall; dead end if ignoring goal.\n- Zigzagging unnecessarily (e.g., DRL): Circumvents nothing needed, longer.\n- Diagonal thinking: Invalid, only cardinal directions.\nPrioritize shortest, obstacle-free path; explore alternatives mentally to confirm optimality and avoid traps.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Direct left on row 1 (LLL)—shortest, no obstacles.\n- Current position: (1,10)\n  Direction moved: L\n  New position: (1,9)\n  Obstacles navigated: None; (1,9) is empty (-).\n- Current position: (1,9)\n  Direction moved: L\n  New position: (1,8)\n  Obstacles navigated: None; (1,8) is empty (-).\n- Current position: (1,8)\n  Direction moved: L\n  New position: (1,7)\n  Obstacles navigated: None; (1,7) is goal (G).\n\nAlternate explored (for learning): Down-left-up path, e.g., D (to 2,10 empty), LLL (to 2,7 empty), U (to 1,7 G).

Avoid col 7 vertical barrier and row 3 horizontal-ish blocks.\n\nFailed approaches:\n- Greedy down: Blocked at row 2 col 3 #.\n- Greedy right to col 7+: Hits walls.\n- Left-first: Viable but longer (~9+ moves), risks dead-end looping around row 3/5 walls.\nGeneric: Evaluate local moves, backtrack mentally on blocks, prefer open corridors (e.g., cols 4-6 mostly clear); extensible via 'obstacle shadowing' (trace wall influences on paths) or prioritizing low-obstacle columns.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: RRDDDDD (right to clear row 2 col 3 #, then straight down col 5 corridor, which is fully open).\n\n- Start: row 1, col 3\n- R → row 1, col 4 (open: row 1 col 4 -)\n- R → row 1, col 5 (open: row 1 col 5 -; avoids col 7 #)\n- D → row 2, col 5 (open: row 2 col 5 -; navigates around row 2 col 3 #)\n- D → row 3, col 5 (open: row 3 col 5 -; avoids row 3 col 3/7 #s)\n- D → row 4, col 5 (open: row 4 col 5 -; col 5 clear past row 5 col 2 #)\n- D → row 5, col 5 (open: row 5 col 5 -)\n- D → row 6, col 5 (goal G; navigates final open descent)\n\nAlternate explored: L D RRR DDDD (left detour) works but 9 moves, dead-ends if LL (hits row 3 col 1 #).

Player starts at row 4, column 5 (@). Goal at row 1, column 4 (G). Wall locations: (1,5), (1,6), (2,2), (2,6), (4,1). All other cells are empty (-). Key constraints: Walls block direct access to parts of the top row (columns 5-6 impassable), a wall at (2,2) blocks left side in row 2, and (4,1) blocks far left in starting row. Patterns: The grid is mostly open (large empty areas in rows 3-6), with walls concentrated in the top half, creating potential chokepoints around row 2 columns 2 and 6. Net displacement needed: 3 units up (row 4 to 1), 1 unit left (col 5 to 4). Manhattan distance: 4 moves minimum, but obstacles may require detours. Bounds: Cannot move outside rows 1-6 or columns 1-9.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist due to open lower grid; shortest paths are ~4 moves. Direct path (left then up) works: left to col 4, then up through open column 4 (rows 4-1 all empty). Alternative: up first to row 2 col 5 (open), left to col 4, then up—also 4 moves but skirts near wall at (2,6). Blocked paths: Cannot go up from (2,5) directly to goal (hits wall at 1,5); must detour left. Going right from start (e.g., to col 6-9) leads to dead ends for goal access, as top-right walls (1,5-6 and 2,6) force long detours leftward across open bottom, inefficient (>10 moves). Downward first (rows 5-6) creates unnecessary loops, potential dead ends if circling without progress up. Traps/dead ends: Approaching (2,6) wall from left/right blocks upward; far left row 4 blocked by (4,1), so cannot hug left wall up. General direction: Primarily up (3 steps), minor left (1 step)—prioritize upward progress while adjusting left. Failing approaches: Greedy up ignores left need, hits (1,5) wall; rightward exploration wastes moves in open space without goal proximity; ignoring bounds risks invalid moves (e.g., left from col 1). Generic strategy: Compute net displacement; check direct path for obstacles; if blocked, identify minimal detours via adjacent columns/rows; mentally simulate BFS layers (distance 1: neighbors; prune walls/bounds); explore branches but prune long/looping paths; verify reversibility (pathfinding is undirected here).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: LUUU (direct left-then-up, minimal moves, avoids all walls).\n- Start: row 4, col 5. Move L → New: row 4, col 4 (empty, navigates toward goal column, avoids distant left wall at col 1).\n- Current: row 4, col 4.

Player starts at (7,3). Goal at (9,5). Wall locations: (1,4), (2,6), (3,1), (4,5), (4,7), (5,1), (6,1). No walls in rows 7, 8, or 9. Patterns/constraints: Bottom three rows (7-9) are completely open (all '-'). Walls are concentrated in upper rows, particularly on the left side (columns 1 in rows 3-6) and scattered in the upper maze-like area (e.g., blocking direct upper paths). Player needs net movement: +2 rows down, +2 columns right. Must stay within bounds (rows 1-9, cols 1-8) and avoid all # cells. No diagonal moves; only U/D/L/R.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist due to fully open bottom area. Shortest paths are 4 moves (Manhattan distance: 2 down + 2 right). Viable strategies: Prioritize downward and rightward moves in rows 7-9 since no walls block there. Direct sequences like DRRD, DDRR, RRDD, RDRD all work as they stay in open space. General direction: Primarily down (to row 9) and right (to column 5).\n\nBlocked paths: Upper areas have mazes—e.g., left wall stack (rows 3-6, col 1) traps if overcommitted leftward; row 4 col 5/7 block center-right. Paths going up from row 7 (e.g., U to row 6 col 3) enter maze, requiring navigation around (1,4), (2,6), etc., to loop back down—much longer (10+ moves) and unnecessary.\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid: Extreme left (col 1, rows 7-9) is open but requires extra right moves later (detour); upper-left corner (near row 3-6 col 1 walls) is a cul-de-sac—can't progress right/up easily without backtracking. Going up and left hits wall stack quickly (e.g., from (7,1) U hits (6,1)#).\n\nApproaches that fail:\n- Going only up: Moves away from goal, enters maze, no direct down path without walls.\n- Going left-first (e.g., LL then down): Reaches bottom-left (9,1), but needs 4 extra rights to goal (total 8 moves); not shortest, risks out-of-bounds left.\n- Ignoring bounds: L from col 1 or U from row 1 invalid.\n- Assuming diagonals: Not allowed.\n\nGeneric strategies (extensible): Use coordinates for precision. Mentally BFS: Level 1 adjacent opens, prioritize goal direction. Visualize 'clear lanes' (here, rows 7-9). Check net displacement vs. obstacles. Prune dead ends by marking 'no-exit' zones (e.g., wall-bounded). For other domains: Decompose to subgoals (e.g., 'reach row 8'), simulate moves, backtrack mentally if blocked.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: DRRD (down-right-right-down; stays in open bottom, minimal moves).\n- Start: (7,3)\n- D: Move down to (8,3) (row 8 col 3 is '-', navigates open space below start; avoids upper walls).\n- R: Move right to (8,4) (row 8 col 4 is '-', clear horizontal lane).\n- R: Move right to (8,5) (row 8 col 5 is '-', aligns with goal column).\n- D: Move down to (9,5) (row 9 col 5 is 'G', reaches goal; no obstacles).\n\nAlternate explored: RRDD—R to (7,4) open, R (7,5) open, D (8,5), D (9,5).

Upward alternate (UDDD...): U to (6,3) open, but then needs ~10 moves around walls (e.g., right, up, left around (1,4)/(2,6)), dead end if left (hits col1 walls)—rejected for efficiency.\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace for DRRD:\n1.

Constraints: cannot pass walls or go out of bounds (rows 1-7, cols 1-7). Patterns: mostly open space, but walls create minor obstacles—top wall irrelevant for path, central wall at row 5 col 4 blocks direct center-down paths, bottom-left wall at row 6 col 1 creates a minor dead-end trap on far left bottom. General path needs to trend down (south) and slightly right (to col 7), covering ~4 rows down and 1 col right. No tight mazes, but pathfinding must avoid the three walls.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths possible due to open grid (e.g., hug right edge, go down center-right, or zigzag). Blocked paths: any through walls, e.g., row 5 col 4 blocks center-down from above; row 6 col 1 blocks left-bottom access. Dead ends/traps: far left bottom (row 6 col 1 #) could trap if over-committing left, but avoidable since goal is right; top wall (row 1 col 3) irrelevant as we move down. General direction: primarily down (4 net downs needed), minor right adjustment. Failing approaches: (1) Going left/up first—wastes moves, risks top wall or looping back; (2) Center-down (e.g., left to col 4 then down)—hits row 5 col 4 #; (3) Far-left down—hits row 6 col 1 #, dead end; (4) Over-right then left—no need, inefficient. Best strategy: shortest path via BFS-like mental search or direct visualization—prioritize right-edge or col 6 down (open column). Right-edge path (R then DDDD) or col-6 down (DDDD then R) both work (5 moves), avoid all walls. Extensible strategy: identify open corridors (cols 5-7 bottom clear), compute Manhattan distance (5 moves min: 4D+1R), prune blocked lines-of-sight.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen: down col 6 (open), then right—avoids row 5 col 4 # naturally.\n- Start: row 2, col 6\n- D: to row 3, col 6 (empty -)\n- D: to row 4, col 6 (empty -)\n- D: to row 5, col 6 (empty -, navigates around row 5 col 4 # by staying right)\n- D: to row 6, col 6 (empty -, avoids row 6 col 1 # by staying right)\n- R: to row 6, col 7 (G)\n\nAlternate explored: R first to row 2 col 7 (empty), D to row 3 col 7, D row 4 col 7, D row 5 col 7 (empty), D row 6 col 7 (G)—also valid, same length.

The wall at (5,1) partially obstructs the upper-left area, preventing passage through that cell but not affecting direct paths to the goal. The wall at (7,7) blocks only the far-right edge of the goal row, irrelevant for reaching (7,2). No other obstacles. Bounds must be respected: cannot move up from row 1, down from row 11, left from column 1, or right from column 7. Net displacement required: up 2 rows (row -= 2), left 1 column (col -= 1). Manhattan distance: 3 moves minimum.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Shortest path requires exactly 2 'U' and 1 'L' in any order, totaling 3 moves. The local area (rows 7-9, columns 2-3) is completely empty, allowing all 3 possible sequences (LUU, ULU, UUL) to succeed without obstruction.\n- Multiple possible paths: Yes, at least 3 shortest paths, plus infinite longer detours (e.g., right then left, down then up). Prioritize shortest to minimize risk in more complex grids.\n- Blocked paths: No direct blocks to goal. However, if detouring left to column 1: row 9 col 1 empty, row 8 col 1 empty, row 7 col 1 empty ('-'), row 6 col 1 empty, but row 5 col 1 is #—a potential block if path requires it. Rightward: open until column 7, where (7,7) # blocks only that cell.\n- Dead ends or traps to avoid: Minor trap in upper-left: reaching (5,1) # dead-ends left/up progress there, but avoidable since goal is at (7,2). No loops or major mazes; open grid favors direct movement. Going down or far right increases distance unnecessarily, risking bounds or inefficiency.\n- General direction: Primarily up (to reduce row from 9 to 7), slightly left (col 3 to 2). Avoid right/down as they oppose goal vector.\n- Why certain approaches fail: Pure lefts (LLL): hits column 1 bound after 2L, doesn't reach goal row. Pure ups (UUU): reaches row 6 col 3 (empty), overshoots goal row without left, then needs to maneuver back down (inefficient). Rightward (RRR): moves to col 6, away from goal, wastes moves. Out-of-bounds moves invalid (e.g., L from col 1). In generic terms, failing approaches ignore net displacement or hit obstacles/bounds.\nGeneric strategies: Compute net Δrow/Δcol for direction. Mentally BFS short paths (here, depth 3). Visualize 2D bounding box (rows 7-9, cols 2-3) for clearance. Enumerate permutations for small distances. Avoid backtracking by preferring goal-aligned moves. Transferable: In domains like chess (king moves) or robotics, prioritize obstacle-free corridors; use A* heuristic (Manhattan) for scaling.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: LUU (aligns column first for safety, then vertical climb; all positions pre-verified empty).\n- Current position: (9,3)\n- Direction: L (left)\n- New position: (9,2) — navigates around no obstacles; row 9 col 2 is '-'; stays in bounds.\n- Current position: (9,2)\n- Direction: U (up)\n- New position: (8,2) — row 8 is all '-', empty; direct vertical move.\n- Current position: (8,2)\n- Direction: U (up)\n- New position: (7,2) — row 7 col 2 is 'G'; reaches goal.\nAlternate paths explored: UUL — (9,3)U(8,3)U(7,3)L(7,2): also clear (row 7 col 3 '-'). ULU — (9,3)U(8,3)L(8,2)U(7,2): clear. Longer: LLUU R (to col1 then back): works but inefficient (5 moves).

Player starts at (row 10, column 6). Goal is at (row 8, column 9). Wall locations: (row 3, column 10) and (row 10, column 10). The grid is mostly empty ('-'), with only two walls on the right edge—one near the top at row 3 col 10 and one at the starting row's right edge at row 10 col 10. Patterns: Open space everywhere except these walls, no clusters or mazes. Constraints: Cannot pass through walls (#), cannot go out of bounds (rows 1-12, cols 1-10). Moves: U (row -1), D (row +1), L (col -1), R (col +1). Delta to goal: up 2 rows (row 10 to 8), right 3 columns (col 6 to 9), Manhattan distance 5 moves minimum.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple possible paths: Yes, numerous due to open grid—any sequence of exactly 3 R and 2 U works in the relevant area (rows 8-10, cols 6-9), as it's completely empty.

Dead ends or traps: Minimal—going R from (10,9) is invalid (wall), but since impassable, player can't enter; however, it traps greedy rightward exploration if not checking ahead. Going down (D) or left (L) excessively leads to longer paths or away from goal (e.g., D to row 11/12 requires coming back up, wasting moves; L to col 1 requires 5 extra R later). No true dead ends without backtracking since open, but inefficient. General direction: Primarily up and right (net -2 row, +3 col). Why certain approaches fail: Pure right-first hits wall if overdo R to col 10 at row 10; pure up-first fine but if then right to col 10 at row 8, empty but unnecessary; going left/down increases distance without benefit, as no walls force detour; ignoring bounds (e.g., LLLLLL from start hits col 0 invalid). Generic strategies: Compute deltas for minimal moves; prioritize net directions (here right then up or mix); mentally simulate short paths checking obstacles/bounds; explore alternatives by considering permutations of required moves; identify local hazards (walls) and avoid adjacent cells; use BFS-like mental expansion for complex grids (here unnecessary due to openness); subgoal decomposition (e.g., first align column at current row, then shift row).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: RRRUU (direct right then up, shortest, avoids wall). \n- Start: (10,6)\n- Move R → (10,7): Empty ('-'), proceeds right along row 10.\n- Move R → (10,8): Empty ('-'), continues right, still clear.\n- Move R → (10,9): Empty ('-'), navigates around impending wall at (10,10).\n- Move U → (9,9): Row 9 col 9 empty ('-'), shifts up safely.\n- Move U → (8,9): Lands on goal 'G'.

Going down leads to longer detours around bottom walls (e.g., row 5 col 3 # forces rightward shift, row 8 col 2 # and row 10/11 cols 2/4 create mazelike bottom but avoidable). Dead ends/traps: Top-right corner (cols 8-9 rows 2-3 partially blocked), bottom-left clusters could trap if over-committing down/left without plan. Approaches that fail: Pure rightward/upward (hits # at row 2/3 col 9); excessive downward exploration (unnecessary distance, risks bottom walls); ignoring bounds (e.g., up from row 1 or left from col 1 invalid). Generic strategy: Mentally simulate BFS-like exploration prioritizing goal direction (Manhattan distance: |4-2| + |8-7| = 3), prune blocked branches early, consider obstacles as hard barriers, explore alternates for robustness. This transfers to pathfinding: decompose into net vectors, identify local blockages, backtrack from dead ends.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: UUL (direct up then left; alternates like LUU equally valid). \n- Current position: row 4, col 8\n- Move U (up): new position row 3, col 8 (open -, navigates around no obstacles, stays right of goal column)\n- Current position: row 3, col 8\n- Move U (up): new position row 2, col 8 (open -, avoids top-right wall at col 9)\n- Current position: row 2, col 8\n- Move L (left): new position row 2, col 7 (G, reaches goal, sidesteps nothing as direct adjacent)\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace:\n1.

Player must move 4 rows up (net 4 U) and 4 columns right (net 4 R) for a minimum path length of 8 moves (Manhattan distance). Cannot pass through # or go out of bounds (rows 1-5, columns 1-6). No other obstacles, so pathfinding is straightforward but requires avoiding the wall trap.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple possible paths exist due to the open grid; any combination of exactly 4 U and 4 R works as long as it avoids the wall at (4,6) and bounds. Shortest paths are 8 moves; longer paths possible if detours occur.\n\nBlocked paths: Any sequence trying to move U from (5,6) directly hits the wall at (4,6), e.g., RRRR U fails immediately. Paths entering column 6 too early (at row 5) create a partial dead end since U is blocked, forcing a detour left/up/right, adding moves (e.g., RRRRLUURUU totals 10 moves).\n\nDead ends or traps: (5,6) is a trap if reached without prior upward progress—can only escape by moving L then U in column 5, then R later. No full dead ends (grid connectivity allows escape), but inefficient. Cannot go beyond column 6 right or row 1 up.\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily up (to row 1) and right (to column 6). Prioritize reaching row 1 before column 6 to use the open top row, or interleave moves to skirt the wall (e.g., reach column 6 at row 3 or above).\n\nApproaches that would NOT work and why:\n- All right then up (RRRRUUUU): Hits wall on first U from (5,6).\n- Going left first (L): Unnecessary detour away from goal, increases path length without benefit.\n- Down from start: Goes to row 6 (out of bounds), invalid.\n- Ignoring net displacement: Paths with extra U/D or L/R cancel out but lengthen solution.\nGeneric strategies: Compute Manhattan distance for lower bound. Visualize obstacles and plan to approach goal from safe adjacent cells (e.g., (1,5) or (2,6)). Test greedy paths (e.g., all U then R) for simplicity.

Wall locations:\n- Row 1, Col 1\n- Row 2, Col 3 and Col 6\n- Row 3, Col 1 and Col 3\n- Row 11, Col 1\n\nPatterns/constraints: The grid is mostly open from rows 4-10 (all empty). Rows 1-3 form a small maze-like area in the top-left with walls blocking direct access, creating potential dead ends if entered. Bottom row (11) has a wall only at Col 1, leaving Col 2-7 open to the goal. Player is in the open lower area; goal is nearby down-right. No walls block the lower 8x7 subgrid except the single wall at (11,1). Pathfinding must stay within 1-11 rows, 1-7 cols; avoid all #.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist due to open lower grid: net movement needed is +3 rows down, +3 columns right. Viable strategies include going right then down (RRRDDD), down then right (DDD RRR), or interleaved (e.g., RDRDRD). All shortest paths are 6 moves.\n\nBlocked paths: Cannot pass walls, e.g., no direct left on row 11 past Col 1 wall. Upper area (rows 1-3) has blocks: walls at (1,1), (2,3),(2,6), (3,1),(3,3) create narrow passages (e.g., can't go straight up from start without zigzagging).\n\nDead ends/traps: Going up from start (e.g., UUU to row 5, col 3) enters open but risks wandering into top maze. Example dead end: reach row 2 col 2 (open), but surrounded by walls left (col1 row1-3), right (col3 row2-3), up (row1 col1 wall blocks); must backtrack down. Traps like row 2 col 6 wall blocks right side. Avoid upward moves entirely—unnecessary (adds 2x distance) and increases error risk.\n\nGeneral direction: Primarily down (to row 11) and right (to col 6). Stay in rows 8-11, cols 1-7.\n\nFailed approaches:\n- Going left/up first: Loops into top dead ends (e.g., U L hits walls, requires 10+ moves to escape).\n- Over-right to col 7 then adjust: Works but longer if zigzag needed (unnecessary).\n- Ignoring bounds: e.g., RRRR from start hits col 7 edge, but still open—no crash but deviates.\n- Down-left to (11,1): Hits wall at (11,1), dead end (cannot pass #).\nBFS/DFS mentally: Shortest paths skirt bottom; upper paths >12 moves.\n\nChosen strategy: Right then down (RRRDDD)—stays row 8 (open cols 1-7), then col 6 down (rows 9-11 open). Simple, no backtrack, extensible to mazes (prioritize goal direction, avoid obstacles).\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen path: RRRDDD (right along row 8 to col 6, then down col 6 to goal).

Also works:\n- D (9,3) open; D (10,3); D (11,3) open; R (11,4); R (11,5); R (11,6) G. Avoids wall at (11,1) by starting rightward from col 3.\nBut RRRDDD chosen for horizontal clearance first.\n\nWhy not up-mixed: e.g., U R D etc.—enters rows 4-7 (open) but risks top; 6 moves possible but adds decision points (e.g., from row 7 col 6, down clear—but why risk?).\n\n# Verification\n\nFull trace of RRRDDD:\n1.

Additional walls inferred from grid: row 4 column 5 is # (part of ----#), row 5 columns 4-5 ##, etc.\n\nPatterns and constraints: Left side has walls in column 1 at rows 1-2, blocking early leftward access there. Right side (column 5) is heavily walled from row 3 downward (rows 3-6 column 5 all #), creating a 'funnel' that forces leftward movement before descending too far right. Bottom-right corner is blocked (row 5 columns 4-5 #, row 6 column 5 #), preventing access to goal from the right. Open spaces dominate the center and left-bottom, but path must navigate around right walls. Manhattan distance: +3 rows down, -1 column left (minimum 4 moves). All moves must stay within 1-6 rows, 1-5 columns; no diagonal moves; walls impassable.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: General direction needed is primarily down (net +3 rows) with a slight left shift (-1 column), but rightward movement is tempting initially yet leads to dead ends due to column 5 walls starting at row 3. Multiple paths exist (e.g., descend right then left at row 4, or left early then descend center-left), both ~4 moves.\n\nBlocked paths: Straight down from start hits wall at (5,4)# after (4,4). Right then down: From (2,4) R to (2,5), then D blocked by (3,5)# -- classic dead end/trap, requires backtracking (L then detour). Bottom-right blocked: Can't reach goal from column 4-5 at row 5. Upward first (U to row 1) possible but inefficient (extra up/down), as goal is below; creates longer path (e.g., 6+ moves). Left to column 1 early safe but longer (绕道 around top-left walls).\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid: Column 5 rows 2+ (can't descend), bottom row 5 column 4-5. Greedy 'right exploration' fails because walls block descent. Certain approaches fail: Pure down (hits # at row5 col4); pure left then down (works but not shortest); right loop (wastes moves). Generic strategy: Mentally map obstacles as 'barriers' forcing pivots (e.g., descend to row 4 col4, then pivot left). Use BFS-like mental search: Explore breadth-first from start, prune blocked branches. Check bounds pre-move. Visualize net displacement. Extensible: In other domains (e.g., mazes, planning), identify chokepoints/barriers early, compute min moves (Manhattan adjusted for walls), test 1-2 step lookaheads to avoid traps, backtrack virtually.\n\nChosen path: Descend right-edge first (DD to row4 col4), pivot left (L to col3), final down (D to goal). Avoids traps, minimal length.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nStart: row 2, col 4.\n- Move D: Navigate around future right walls by descending open column 4. New position: row 3, col 4 (empty -).\n- Move D: Continue down open path in column 4, before right walls fully block. New position: row 4, col 4 (empty -).\n- Move L: Pivot left at row 4 to align with goal column 3, avoiding blocked (5,4)# below.

All shortest paths succeed since no walls block horizontal or vertical movement in the relevant area. No true dead ends or traps, as the grid is fully connected—can always backtrack from bounds (e.g., reaching column 1 blocks further left but allows right/up/down). General direction: Primarily right (to cover +3 columns), with a minor down adjustment (+1 row); prefer moving right first to align column before row change, reducing risk of bound violations. Paths blocked: None by walls; however, paths going excessively left (e.g., LLLL from start hits column 0 invalid), up (UUU to row -1 invalid), or down (to row 8 then needing to return) are inefficient or invalid if exceeding bounds. Dead ends to avoid: None structurally, but 'soft traps' like corners (row 1 col 1) require backtracking, increasing path length—avoid by prioritizing goal-directed moves. Alternate paths explored: (1) Direct RRR D: stays in row 2 then down—efficient. (2) DRRR: down first to row 3 col 4 (empty), then right along goal row—also efficient. (3) U RRR DD: up detour then compensate—6 moves, unnecessary. Why certain approaches fail: (1) Pure left/down: e.g., LLL D moves to row 3 col 1, succeeds but 4 moves with no net right progress initially, then requires 6+ extra R—inefficient. (2) Ignoring bounds: RRRR D goes to col 11 invalid. (3) Assuming diagonals or jumps: Not allowed; only cardinal moves. (4) Wall misperception: Treating empty cells as # blocks valid paths. Generic strategies: (a) Compute Manhattan distance for lower bound. (b) Greedy: Reduce largest delta first (here columns). (c) Simulate paths mentally/BFS-like: Expand neighbors, prune out-of-bounds.

Alternative: Partial left on row 3 to column 3, then down to row 6 column 3, left 2 more (also 8 moves).\n\nBlocked paths:\n- Direct left on row 3: L from (3,6) to (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), then L hits (3,2)#.\n- Left then down through row 5 col 4: e.g., LLDD from start -> (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (5,4)# invalid.\n\nDead ends/traps to avoid:\n- Right to column 7, down to row 5: (5,7)# blocks further down; forces backtrack (minor trap, escapable via left/up).\n- Up to row 1 column 7: (1,7)# blocks right/up, but open left/down.\n\nApproaches that fail:\n- Greedy left-first: Hits (3,2)# or (5,4)#.\n- Ignoring row 5 walls: Paths down-left hit (5,4)#.\n- Boundary overshoot: No risk if checking bounds.\n\nGeneric strategies (extensible to other domains):\n- Model as graph: Positions as nodes, valid moves as edges; BFS for shortest path (mental simulation here).\n- Identify safe subgoals: e.g., 'reach open row 6', then 'slide left'.\n- Blockers require detour: Quantify (e.g., wall at col2 needs go-around via row change).\n- Prune invalid: Pre-check local obstacles before committing.\n- Heuristics: Prioritize goal direction but verify obstacles; backtrack on dead ends.\n- Transferable: Applies to mazes, routing, planning—decompose, simulate alternatives, verify bounds/constraints.\n\nChosen: Down-first to (6,6) via open column 6 (avoids row 5 walls), then left on row 6.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nStart: (3,6)\n- Move D: To (4,6) [row 4 fully open, no obstacle].\n- Move D: To (5,6) [row 5 col6 open, navigates right of (5,4)#].\n- Move D: To (6,6) [row 6 open].\n- Move L: To (6,5) [row 6 open].\n- Move L: To (6,4) [open].\n- Move L: To (6,3) [open].\n- Move L: To (6,2) [open].\n- Move L: To (6,1) [goal G].\n\nThis avoids walls by using column 6 (safe vertical path) and row 6 (safe horizontal).\n\n# Verification\n\nTrace entire solution (DDDLLLLL):\n- Start: (3,6)\n- 1.

Player starts at row 1, column 7 (@). Goal is at row 6, column 5 (G). Key wall locations (#) that affect pathfinding include:\n- Row 1: columns 1, 4\n- Row 2: column 5\n- Row 3: columns 2, 4\n- Row 4: columns 4, 5\n- Row 5: column 6\n- Row 6: column 3\n- Row 7: column 2\n\nPatterns and constraints: A cluster of walls in rows 3-4, columns 4-5 blocks direct diagonal progress down-left. The right side (columns 7-8) is mostly open down to the bottom, providing a clear corridor. The goal is accessible from the right in row 6, but row 5 column 6 is a wall, creating a potential trap if moving left too early. No walls in column 7 from row 1 to row 6, making it a safe vertical path. Bounds must be respected (no moves outside 1-8). General net movement needed: down 5 rows, left 2 columns.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nStrategic considerations: Multiple paths exist, but the simplest and safest is to descend the open right corridor in column 7 to row 6, then move left to the goal, avoiding the row 5 column 6 wall.\n\n- Paths blocked: Direct down-left from start hits walls (e.g., row 2 col 5 # blocks early left-down moves). Central area (rows 3-5, cols 3-6) is maze-like with # at (3,4), (4,4-5), (5,6), forcing detours.\n- Dead ends/traps: Entering row 5 col 6 is impossible (#), so from row 5 col 7, left is blocked—must go down to row 6 first. Going too far left early (e.g., row 1 col 4 #) or into lower left (row 6 col 3 #, row 7 col 2 #) leads to backtracking. Bottom row 8 is open but overshoots goal.\n- General direction: Primarily down (5 steps net), then left (2 steps). Right side is low-risk.\n- Failing approaches: \n  - Straight left then down: Hits row 1 col 4 # or row 2 col 5 #.\n  - Down to row 5 col 7 then left: Blocked by row 5 col 6 #, trapping player (must backtrack up, inefficient).\n  - Zigzagging center: Risks walls (e.g., row 4 cols 4-5 ##), longer and error-prone.\n\nGeneric strategies: Visualize grid mentally or sketch; prioritize open corridors (column 7 here). Use net displacement but check obstacles. Explore adjacent moves, identify 'safe highways' (open columns/rows). Avoid greedily moving toward goal if blocked—BFS-like: breadth of safe steps first. Test alternates mentally: simulate short paths, flag dead ends early. Transferable: In other domains (mazes, routing), catalog obstacles, compute Manhattan distance adjusted for blocks, prefer perimeter paths in walled areas.\n\n# Step-By-Step Execution\n\nChosen solution: Descend column 7 fully to row 6 column 7 (safest open path), then left twice. This navigates around the row 5 col 6 wall by delaying left moves.\n\n- Start: row 1, col 7\n- D → row 2, col 7 (open -; avoids early left walls)\n- D → row 3, col 7 (open -)\n- D → row 4, col 7 (open -; skirts row 4 col 5 #)\n- D → row 5, col 7 (open -; navigates around row 5 col 6 # by not going left yet)\n- D → row 6, col 7 (open -)\n- L → row 6, col 6 (open -)\n- L → row 6, col 5 (goal G)\n\nAlternate explored: Down to row 5 col 7 (DDDD), L blocked, so D then LL works but same length. Shorter? Try R to col 8 first, down, left—but longer. Left-down mix hits blocks.\n\n# Verification\n\nTrace entire solution move-by-move:\n1. Start: (1,7)\n2.

All other cells are empty (- or G).\n\nPatterns/constraints: Walls are sparse but create local blocks—row 7 has walls at col 6 and 9, blocking direct up-moves from row 8 cols 6/9; row 4 walls at cols 8-9 block right-side access to goal row; row 3 col 5 and row 1 cols 3/5 create minor top-center obstructions but irrelevant for this path. Must stay in bounds (no row 0/9, col 0/11). General need: move up 4 rows, left 3 columns, avoiding these blocks.\n\n# Strategy Analysis\n\nMultiple paths exist due to open space in center-left. Viable strategies: (1) Move up column 7 to row 4, then left to col 4 (avoids all walls). (2) Move left to column 4 in row 8, then up to row 4 (also open, as row 7 cols 1-5 empty). Both length 7 moves, shortest possible (Manhattan distance 7).\n\nBlocked paths: Cannot up from row 8 col 6 (hits row 7 col 6 #)—dead end, must detour right/left. Cannot reach row 4 col 8/9 (walls). Right-heavy paths fail: up column 8 hits row 4 col 8 #; column 9 blocked at row 7 col 9 #. Left to col 6 row 8 then up traps you (no up), forcing backtrack—avoid by not lingering left of col 7 without planning up-route.\n\nDead ends/traps: Row 8 col 6 (up blocked); row 7 col 9 (cannot reach easily); top walls (row 1/3) irrelevant but could trap if overshooting up-left unnecessarily. General direction: primarily up (4 steps) and left (3), prioritizing columns 4-7 for openness.\n\nFailed approaches: Straight right then up (hits row 4 col 8 #, cannot left into goal without backtrack). Up col 6 (immediate wall).

No, row1 col7 wall).\n  - Early descent to row 4 columns 4-6: Reachable via up-right-down, but then wall at (4,7) blocks goal without re-ascending (e.g., from (4,6) must up to row3 col6, right past col7, etc., adding moves).\n\nGeneric strategies: Mentally map open corridors (row 3 as 'highway'). Identify local blocks and global paths. Consider dead ends by checking 1-step escapes. Prioritize minimal vertical deviation for horizontal goals. Explore alternatives mentally (BFS-like: level-by-level expansion) to confirm viability and avoid traps.
