Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Move the player to the right to get behind the box at r6c7:\n   - R (r6c5)\n   - R (r6c6)\n   - R (r6c7)\n\n2. Push the box at r6c7 down to r7c7:\n   - D (push box to r7c7, player to r6c7)\n\n3. Move the player back to the left to get behind the box at r5c7:\n   - L (r6c6)\n   - U (r5c6)\n\n4.
