Edges (col2 left, col5 right) are deadlock-prone: boxes there can't be pushed toward center (no player space beyond walls). This plan never leaves boxes on col2 or col5; all pushes are single steps toward goals from safe positions.

Placing the irreversible r5c5 goal first (horizontally immovable due to walls at c6 row5 and inability to access right side for push left) but using a temporary vertical relocation to make space for the second placement.\\n\\n2. **Why Avoids Deadlocks:** Moving upper first prevents stacking deadlock at col7 (can't push two up/down/left/right initially) and clears row3 path without trapping lower on dead-end right side row5 c7/c8 (blocked by c6#). Temporary upward move of upper box from r5c5 to r3c5 is reversible (via row2c5 push down), avoiding permanent block or corner traps (e.g., r3c2, r5c2, r4c2 unreachable for boxes reversibly).

      "rawResponse": "{\"reasoning\":\"Identify boxes by initial positions: Box A (r3c3), Box B (r3c4), Box C (r4c3). Assign: Box B to goal r4c6 first, Box C to r4c7 second, Box A to r4c8 third. This order allows systematic disentangling of the initial L-shaped cluster without trapping any box in deadlock areas (row2 c2-c5, row5 c2-c4, or row3/4 c2 without left access for pushing right).\\n\\nStep-by-step strategy:\\n1. Player enters left area via row2 c9 to row3 c9. Maneuver via row2 c2-c5 (player only) to row4 c2. Push Box C right to r4c4 (clears under A). Clear r4c3, maneuver player via row2 c3 to r2c3, push Box A down to r4c3.\\n2. Row3 now clear except Box B at r3c4; push Box B right along row3 to r3c9 (5 pushes). Player goes via row4 c8 (passage to right side) to row2 c9, pushes Box B down to r4c9. Player repositions via right side to r4c10, pushes left 3 times: r4c8, r4c7, r4c6 goal.\\n3. Boxes A (r4c3) and C (r4c4) parked safely in row4 left (retrievable upward). Player returns via r3c7. Go via row5 c2-c4 (player only) to r5c4, push Box C up to r3c4. Player loops via row5 c2 to r3c2 (bypassing A at r4c3 without moving it), pushes Box C right along r3 to r3c9 (5 pushes). Repeat down push via row2 c9 to r4c9, reposition to r4c10, push left 2 times to r4c7 goal.\\n4. Last Box A at r4c3. Player returns via r3c8 to r3c2, via r4c2-r5c2 to r5c3, pushes A up to r3c3. Player to r3c2 via r4c2, pushes A right along r3 to r3c9 (6 pushes, possible since player access at c2). Repeat down to r4c9, reposition to r4c10, push left once to r4c8 goal.\\n\\nThis avoids deadlocks by: (a) never placing boxes in row2 left or row5; (b) parking in row4 c3/c4 only temporarily, retrieving via row5 player access; (c) moving rightmost parked box first each time; (d) using row3 c2 player access for pushing (ensured empty); (e) multiple passages (r3c8/9 down to r4c8/9, row2 c9) for player to right side without crossing walls with boxes. Critical moves: player loops via row5 for bypassing parked boxes; exact push counts per box (3/2/1 lefts) to target goals without pushing into occupied spots.\",\"solution\":[\"UP\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"DOWN\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"UP\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"DOWN\",\"DOWN\",\"RIGHT\",\"LEFT\",\"UP\",\"UP\",\"RIGHT\",\"DOWN\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"DOWN\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"UP\",\"UP\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"DOWN\",\"UP\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"DOWN\",\"DOWN\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"UP\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"DOWN\",\"DOWN\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"UP\",\"DOWN\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"UP\",\"UP\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"DOWN\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"UP\",\"UP\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"DOWN\",\"UP\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"DOWN\",\"DOWN\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"UP\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"DOWN\",\"DOWN\",\"RIGHT\",\"UP\",\"LEFT\",\"UP\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"DOWN\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"UP\",\"UP\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"DOWN\",\"UP\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"DOWN\",\"DOWN\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\"]}"
