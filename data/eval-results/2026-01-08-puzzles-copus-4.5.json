      "rawResponse": "Looking at this puzzle, I need to push 4 boxes (3 Orange, 1 Sky) onto 4 goals while ensuring same-colored boxes never become adjacent.\n\nLet me analyze the layout:\n- Goals are at: r4c8, r5c8, r6c8, r8c6\n- Orange boxes: r5c3, r6c4, r7c3\n- Sky box: r5c5\n- Player: r5c4\n\nThe three goals on column 8 are vertically adjacent. Since I have 3 Orange boxes, I CANNOT place them all in adjacent goals - that would violate the same-color adjacency rule. So I need to interleave: place Orange boxes at r4c8 and r6c8, and Sky at r5c8. The remaining Orange goes to r8c6.\n\nLet me plan the order carefully:\n\n1. First, I should move the Sky box (r5c5) to r5c8 - this goes to the middle goal\n2. Then move Orange boxes to r4c8 and r6c8 (top and bottom of the column 8 goals)\n3. Finally, move an Orange box to r8c6\n\nLet me trace the moves:\n\nStarting: Player at r5c4, Sky at r5c5\n\n1. Push Sky right toward r5c8:\n   - RIGHT: Push Sky from r5c5 to r5c6\n   - RIGHT: Push Sky from r5c6 to r5c7\n   - RIGHT: Push Sky from r5c7 to r5c8 ✓ (Sky on goal)\n\n2. Now I need to push an Orange to r6c8. Orange at r6c4 is good for this.\n   - Player is at r5c7. Need to get behind the Orange at r6c4.\n   - DOWN, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT: Player to r6c4... wait, that's where the box is.\n   \nLet me reconsider positioning:\n- After pushing Sky, player is at r5c7\n- Go DOWN to r6c7, LEFT to r6c6, LEFT to r6c5, LEFT to r6c4? No, box there.\n- Need to go around: DOWN to r6c7, DOWN to r7c7? Wall. \n\nLet me re-trace more carefully:\n- After Sky pushed to r5c8, player at r5c7\n- DOWN to r6c7, LEFT to r6c6, LEFT to r6c5, DOWN to r7c5? Wall at r7c5.\n- Try: LEFT to r5c6, DOWN to r6c6, DOWN to r7c6? Wall.\n\nActually looking at row 7: #-O-###-#, so r7c5,6,7 are walls.\n\nLet me go: r5c7 → LEFT to r5c6 → LEFT to r5c5 → DOWN to r6c5 → LEFT to r6c4 pushes Orange to r6c3.\nThen continue to push Orange at r6c3... \n\nThis is getting complex. Let me restart with a cleaner approach:\n\nPush Orange at r6c4 to r6c8 first, then Sky to r5c8, then work on others.\n\nFrom r5c4:\n- DOWN: Push Orange r6c4 to r6c5\n- DOWN, RIGHT: Push Orange r6c5 to r6c6\n- Continue pushing right to r6c8\n\nThen handle Sky and remaining oranges.\n\n{\"reasoning\":\"Strategy: Place boxes on goals avoiding same-color adjacency.

I need to place boxes so no two same-colored boxes are adjacent.\n\n**Planning the goal arrangement:**\n- r6c5: Purple (already there)\n- r6c6: Must be Orange (can't be Purple - adjacent to Purple)\n- r6c7: Can be Orange or Purple\n- r6c8: Depends on r6c7\n- r6c9: Depends on r6c8\n\nWith 3 Orange and 2 Purple, a valid arrangement could be: P-O-O-O-P or P-O-P-O-O\nBut we only have 2 Purple boxes, so: P(r6c5), O, P, O, O won't work (two O's adjacent at end)\nLet me try: P, O, O, P, O - but that has two O's adjacent at r6c6-r6c7. Invalid.\n\nActually with P at r6c5, I need: P, O, ?, O, ? where no same colors touch.\nValid: P, O, P, O, O - No! O at c8 and c9 would be adjacent.\nValid: P, O, O - wait, that's adjacent Os.\n\nLet me reconsider: P, O, P, O, O has Os at positions 8,9 which ARE adjacent - invalid.\nI need to move the purple from r6c5 and rearrange.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: I have 3 Orange, 2 Purple for 5 goals.\nPattern: O, P, O, P, O would work (alternating) - no same colors adjacent.\n\n**Execution plan:**\n1. First, push the purple at r6c5 off or reposition\n2. Place boxes in alternating pattern: O-P-O-P-O\n\nLet me trace the moves:\n\n1.

Then reposition to push other boxes. The key is alternating colors: keeping Orange boxes separated by Purple boxes.

      "rawResponse": "Looking at this puzzle, I need to push 6 boxes onto 6 goals while respecting the same-color adjacency rule.\n\n**Analyzing the layout:**\n- Goals are clustered at r4c2, r4c3, r4c4, r5c3, r5c4, r6c4\n- Orange boxes: r11c6, r5c7, r7c3\n- Emerald box: r3c4\n- Purple box: r9c7\n- Sky box: r3c6\n\n**Strategy:**\nSince I have 3 Orange boxes and they can't be adjacent, I need to place them carefully on non-adjacent goals. The goals form a pattern where r4c2, r4c4, and r6c4 are not all adjacent to each other, so Orange boxes could go there.\n\nLet me trace paths:\n\n1. **Emerald (r3c4)** - Can be pushed down to r4c4 (goal)\n2. **Sky (r3c6)** - Needs to reach a goal, likely r4c3 or r5c3\n3. **Orange boxes** - Need careful placement to avoid adjacency\n4. **Purple (r9c7)** - Needs to reach a goal\n\n**Execution plan:**\n\nStarting at r12c2, I need to:\n1. First push the Orange at r7c3 up to goal area\n2. Push Emerald down to a goal\n3. Push Sky to a goal\n4.

Then I reposition to push the Emerald box at r3c4 down to r4c4. Next, I push the Sky box at r3c6 left and down toward r4c3. I then work on getting the Orange box at r5c7 pushed left to r5c4, but must ensure no Orange adjacency. The Purple box at r9c7 gets pushed up and left to r5c3. Finally, I retrieve the Orange at r11c6 and push it to r4c2.
