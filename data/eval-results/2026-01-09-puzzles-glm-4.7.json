The goals are located at (2,6), (2,7), (3,6), (3,7) forming a 2x2 cluster, and (7,1) isolated. The 'Same Color Adjacency' rule means we cannot place two Orange or two Purple boxes next to each other. This forces a checkerboard pattern in the 2x2 cluster. The only valid configuration is: (2,6)=Purple, (2,7)=Orange, (3,6)=Orange, (3,7)=Purple. The isolated goal (7,1) must take the remaining Orange box.\\n\\nThe strategy is:\\n1. Move O2 (at 4,5) to the isolated goal (7,1) first to clear the bottom area and simplify the cluster.\\n2. Move O1 (at 3,4) to (2,7). This must be done early because (2,7) is accessible only via (2,6) or (3,7), which will be filled by Purple boxes later, potentially locking O1 out.\\n3. Move O3 (at 5,6) to (3,6).\\n4. Move P1 (at 6,7) to (3,7). This requires moving P2 out of the way first.\\n5. Move P2 (at 7,6) to (2,6) to complete the puzzle.\\n\\nThis order ensures no deadlocks and respects the color adjacency rule throughout.\",\n  \"solution\": [\n    \"UP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"UP\", \"LEFT\", \"UP\", \"LEFT\", \"UP\", \"LEFT\", \"UP\", \"UP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"DOWN\", \"DOWN\", \"DOWN\", \"DOWN\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"UP\", \"UP\", \"LEFT\", \"UP\", \"LEFT\", \"UP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"UP\", \"DOWN\", \"DOWN\", \"UP\", \"UP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"DOWN\", \"DOWN\", \"LEFT\", \"UP\", \"UP\", \"UP\", \"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"UP\", \"UP\", \"RIGHT\", \"LEFT\", \"UP\", \"UP\", \"RIGHT\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
