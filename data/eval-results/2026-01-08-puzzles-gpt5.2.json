So the final configuration necessarily requires Sky at r5c8.\\n\\nHowever, placing Sky at r5c8 permanently blocks vertical movement through column 8. With r5c8 occupied, an orange cannot be pushed into r4c8 from below (the only practical entry), and r4c8 cannot be reached from the left because r5c7 is a wall and the row-3 corridor cannot be used to introduce a box into r4c8 or r4c7 (row-3’s left side is walled off and column-8 access is cut once r5c8 is occupied). Thus, once Sky is on r5c8, r4c8 becomes unreachable for any remaining orange.\\n\\nTrying to place an orange onto r4c8 before Sky goes to r5c8 requires temporarily moving an orange through r5c8 and then into r4c8. But doing so forces subsequent Sky routing to pass through the right-side upper access (via r4c6/r4c7 or column 8), which becomes blocked by the orange now fixed at r4c8 (since the only top-right access routes depend on column 8 continuity). This creates an unavoidable routing deadlock: you can either secure r4c8 with an orange or route Sky into r5c8, but not both without violating reachability.\\n\\nTherefore there is no sequence of legal moves that places all four boxes onto the four goals while respecting the same-color adjacency rule.\",\"solution\":[]}"
