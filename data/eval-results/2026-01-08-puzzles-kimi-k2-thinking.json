The player starts in the left‑hand region (columns 2‑6) and can never reach the right‑hand side of the board (columns 8‑9) because the only passages leading upward (column 8 and column 9) are blocked by the two purple boxes. One purple box sits at (7,8) blocking column 8; the other sits at (8,7) blocking row 8. To move either purple box out of the way you would need to stand on the opposite side of it, but those opposite squares are in the unreachable right‑hand region. Consequently no box can be pushed at all – the player cannot even reach any of the three orange boxes in the upper area, nor can any purple box be moved without causing an illegal same‑color adjacency. Because the two purple boxes are forever stuck and the player can never access the upper part of the board, it is impossible to place any box on a goal.

All other floor cells are isolated by walls or by the box at (5,7).  \\n2. **Accessible boxes** – The only box the player can ever touch is the orange box O2 at (4,10). The other orange boxes (O1 at (4,6) and O3 at (5,7)) and the purple box at (3,8) lie in the left half of the board, which the player can never reach because column 10 is a wall on rows 3‑7 and the corridor at row 2 cannot be accessed from below.  \\n3. **O2’s possible moves** – O2 can only slide left/right on row 4. Moving it left would eventually place it adjacent to O1 (same‑color adjacency) before O1 can be moved, which the rules forbid. Moving it right is impossible because the player cannot get on the left side of O2 to push it.  \\n4. **Goal access** – The only goal O2 could theoretically reach is the top‑left goal at (4,2), but reaching it would require O1 to move left first, which cannot happen without the player standing at (4,7) – a cell that remains blocked by O3 until O3 moves down. O3 cannot be moved down because the player cannot get above it (the only way to reach (4,7) is from below, which is blocked by O3 itself).  \\n5. **Conclusion** – Because the player can never access three of the four boxes and the one accessible box cannot be placed on any goal without creating an illegal same‑color adjacency, no sequence of legal moves can solve the puzzle.

The strategy is: 1) Move Orange box from (11,6) up to (6,6) then right into goal (6,7), 2) Move Sky box from (7,6) down to (5,6) then right into goal (5,7), 3) Move Orange box from (5,5) right to (5,6), up to (4,6), then right into goal (4,7), 4) Navigate Sky box from (10,3) through the bottom corridor (rows 11-13) to column 6, then up to (3,6) and right into goal (3,7), 5) Move Orange box from (8,3) up to (2,3) then right into goal (2,7). The critical constraint is maintained by ensuring no two same-colored boxes are ever placed in adjacent cells during movement, using walls and empty cells as buffers. The final arrangement has Orange boxes at rows 2,4,6 and Sky boxes at rows 3,5, creating the required alternating pattern.\",\n  \"solution\": [\"DOWN\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"UP\",\"UP\",\"UP\",\"UP\",\"UP\",\"RIGHT\",\"DOWN\",\"LEFT\",\"UP\",\"RIGHT\",\"UP\",\"LEFT\",\"DOWN\",\"RIGHT\",\"UP\",\"UP\",\"LEFT\",\"DOWN\",\"RIGHT\",\"UP\",\"LEFT\",\"UP\",\"RIGHT\",\"DOWN\",\"LEFT\",\"UP\",\"RIGHT\",\"UP\",\"LEFT\",\"DOWN\",\"RIGHT\",\"UP\",\"UP\",\"LEFT\",\"RIGHT\",\"DOWN\",\"LEFT\",\"UP\",\"RIGHT\",\"UP\",\"LEFT\"]\n}\n```"
