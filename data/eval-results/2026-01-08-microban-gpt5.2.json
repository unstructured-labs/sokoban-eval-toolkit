Therefore r5c3 must be filled by moving the r5c4 box.\\n- Moving r5c4 -> r5c3 does not trap the box in a corner (it still has free space above/below/left) and it also creates an empty goal at r5c4, enabling the clean downward push from r4c4.\\n- After r4c4 is pushed down, r4c4 becomes empty and accessible as the final destination for the r4c3 box, which can then be pushed straight RIGHT without getting stuck against walls.\\n\\n3) Box paths and required clearing\\n- Box at r5c4: pushed LEFT into r5c3 (goal). No other boxes need to move first; the player only needs to reach r5c5.\\n- Box at r4c4: pushed DOWN into r5c4 (goal).

To fill r3c3 without ever trapping a box, the key observations are: (1) never push a box into row2, because row1 is all walls so you can never push a box back down into row3; (2) row5 is a dead end for boxes (row6 is walls), so never push a box down into row5; (3) the only safe “elevator” to move boxes between row4 and row3 is column 6 (and 7, but column 7 is against a wall on the right so a box there can’t be pushed left), so we use column 6 to bring boxes back up.\\n\\nStrategy / order:\\n1) Send the rightmost box (from r3c6) down into row4 at column 6 to clear the top row and create workspace.\\n2) Temporarily send the box from r3c5 down into row4 (safe because it can later be shifted to column 6 and lifted back up). This opens r3c5 so the player can stand there.\\n3) With r3c5 open, push the box at r3c4 left into the empty goal r3c3. This achieves the hard-to-reach goal first.\\n4) Bring the r4c6 box back up through the column-6 “elevator” to r3c6, then push it left onto goal r3c5.\\n5) Now only goal r3c4 is empty and the remaining box is in row4 (r4c5).

This avoids needing to stand on an already-occupied goal square to make later pushes.\\n   - To place a box on r4c6, we must push from r4c7 with the player standing on r4c8 (so r4c8 must be empty at that moment).\\n   - Then we place the next box on r4c7 (from r4c8), and finally the last box on r4c8 (from r4c9).\\n2) Before transporting any box, separate the two adjacent top-row boxes (r3c3 and r3c4). If left adjacent, neither can be pushed right because each blocks the other. So we first push the r3c4 box DOWN to r4c4 to free the r3 corridor.\\n\\nWhy no deadlocks:\\n- We never park a box in a non-goal corner. The only tight wall contact is along row4’s bottom wall, but we only leave boxes there when they are being actively moved toward the goals.\\n- The right corridor remains navigable because after each drop to r4c9 we immediately shift the box left (off r4c9), keeping the drop point free for the next box.\\n\\nBox-by-box routing:\\n- Box 1 (from r3c3): after separating, push it along row3 to r3c9, drop to r4c9, push left to r4c7, then left to r4c6 (goal).\\n- Box 2 (from r4c4, originally r3c4): push it UP to row3, push along row3 to r3c9, drop to r4c9, push left to r4c8, then left to r4c7 (goal).\\n- Box 3 (from r4c3): push it UP to row3, push along row3 to r3c9, drop to r4c9, push left once to r4c8 (goal).\\n\\nCritical repositioning notes:\\n- Each time a box is at r3c9, the player must get to r2c9 to push it DOWN into r4c9.

The only recovery is the standard detour:\\n   - move the box from r9c5 to r9c4,\\n   - push it up to r8c4 from r10c4,\\n   - then push it right from r8c4 to r8c5 from r8c3,\\n   - and only then can it be pushed up the column-5 shaft toward the goals.\\n\\n5) Crucially, the “detour lane” r9c4/r10c4/r8c4 and the “push-from-left” square r8c3 must be free when recovering a box from r9c5.\\n\\nWhy this creates an unavoidable contradiction:\\n- To free r3c5 (the doorway) at the start, the left box must be driven down to r9c5 and then shifted to r9c4 (since shifting to r9c6 deadlocks: it cannot be moved further due to walls at r8c6/r9c7 and the impossibility of pushing back left).\\n- But a box sitting at r9c4 is trapped in column 4 (it cannot be pushed right back to r9c5 because r9c3 is a wall, and it cannot be moved to any other column). The only squares it can occupy are r8c4/r9c4/r10c4.\\n- Those three squares (r8c4, r9c4, r10c4) are exactly the squares that must be available for the recovery detour of the other box coming from r9c5.\\n- Therefore, as long as the first box is “parked” anywhere in column 4 (r8c4/r9c4/r10c4), the second box can never perform the required r9c5→r9c4→r8c4→r8c5 recovery step.\\n- Trying to instead finish the first box onto the goals before recovering the second also fails: placing a box on r2c5 blocks the only horizontal route needed to reach r3c7 (required to push the r3c6 box left into r3c5), since the upper pocket has no alternative bypass around r2c5.\\n\\nThus, whichever order you attempt:\\n- If you park box1 in column 4 to open the doorway, box2 can never be recovered upward from the r9c5 trap (because column 4 is occupied).\\n- If you place box1 on the goals first to clear column 4, you lose access to the right side needed to move box2 into r3c5.\\n\\nThis is a structural deadlock contradiction, so the position has no complete solution.\",\"solution\":[]}"

This clears c9, so later we can walk freely between left and right along row 5 without needing to use the upper corridor again.\\n4) Boxing onto goals:\\n- Box C: with c7 cleared and access restored, push C into column 8 at r5c8, then push it straight up three times to land on r2c8.\\n- Box B: push B along row 5 into r5c8, then push it up twice; it stops at r3c8 because r2c8 is occupied.\\n- Box A: push A along row 5 into r5c8, then push it up once to r4c8.\\n5) Critical repositioning:\\n- Each time before pushing a box UP from r5c8, the player must get to r6c8 (below) via the open row 7 corridor, because row 6 has blocking pillars and r6c7 is a wall.\\n\\nFollowing these steps avoids all common Sokoban deadlocks (cornering, wall-locking at c10, and immovable horizontal clumping) while using column 8 as a controlled “chute” to stack boxes onto the goals top-down.\",\n  \"solution\": [\n    \"LEFT\",\n    \"DOWN\",\n    \"DOWN\",\n    \"RIGHT\",\n    \"RIGHT\",\n    \"RIGHT\",\n    \"RIGHT\",\n    \"UP\",\n    \"UP\",\n    \"LEFT\",\n    \"LEFT\",\n    \"DOWN\",\n    \"DOWN\",\n    \"RIGHT\",\n    \"RIGHT\",\n    \"RIGHT\",\n    \"RIGHT\",\n    \"UP\",\n    \"UP\",\n    \"LEFT\",\n    \"LEFT\",\n    \"RIGHT\",\n    \"RIGHT\",\n    \"UP\",\n    \"UP\",\n    \"UP\",\n    \"UP\",\n    \"RIGHT\",\n    \"RIGHT\",\n    \"DOWN\",\n    \"DOWN\",\n    \"DOWN\",\n    \"DOWN\",\n    \"LEFT\",\n    \"LEFT\",\n    \"DOWN\",\n    \"DOWN\",\n    \"LEFT\",\n    \"LEFT\",\n    \"UP\",\n    \"UP\",\n    \"RIGHT\",\n    \"LEFT\",\n    \"DOWN\",\n    \"DOWN\",\n    \"RIGHT\",\n    \"RIGHT\",\n    \"UP\",\n    \"UP\",\n    \"UP\",\n    \"UP\",\n    \"DOWN\",\n    \"DOWN\",\n    \"DOWN\",\n    \"DOWN\",\n    \"LEFT\",\n    \"LEFT\",\n    \"LEFT\",\n    \"LEFT\",\n    \"UP\",\n    \"UP\",\n    \"RIGHT\",\n    \"RIGHT\",\n    \"RIGHT\",\n    \"LEFT\",\n    \"DOWN\",\n    \"DOWN\",\n    \"RIGHT\",\n    \"RIGHT\",\n    \"UP\",\n    \"UP\",\n    \"UP\",\n    \"DOWN\",\n    \"DOWN\",\n    \"DOWN\",\n    \"LEFT\",\n    \"LEFT\",\n    \"LEFT\",\n    \"LEFT\",\n    \"LEFT\",\n    \"LEFT\",\n    \"UP\",\n    \"UP\",\n    \"RIGHT\",\n    \"RIGHT\",\n    \"RIGHT\",\n    \"RIGHT\",\n    \"RIGHT\",\n    \"LEFT\",\n    \"DOWN\",\n    \"DOWN\",\n    \"RIGHT\",\n    \"RIGHT\",\n    \"UP\",\n    \"UP\"\n  ]\n}"
