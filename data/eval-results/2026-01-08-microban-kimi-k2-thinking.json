Boxes B and C are already on goals; only A needs to be placed on a goal. The only free goal is (5,3), but A cannot be pushed directly down because the cell above it (3,3) is a wall. Therefore we must temporarily move the other boxes to free a path for A.\\n\\n2. First move – push C onto the empty goal (5,3): The player moves from (3,4) → (3,5) → (4,5) → (5,5) (RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN). From (5,5) the player pushes C left onto (5,3) (LEFT). This places C on a goal and leaves (5,4) empty.\\n\\n3. Second move – push B down onto the now‑empty (5,4): The player returns to the top of B by moving (5,5) → (4,5) → (3,5) → (3,4) (RIGHT, UP, UP, LEFT). From (3,4) the player pushes B down onto (5,4) (DOWN). B is now on a goal and (4,4) becomes empty.\\n\\n4.

The leftmost box (col5) and the middle box (col7) can be pushed right into column 8 and then upward onto the goals. However, the rightmost box at (5,9) must be pushed left into column 8 to be moved upward. Pushing it left places the player at (5,9) with the box at (5,8). From that position the player cannot reach the cell below the box (6,8) because the cells (6,9) and (4,9) are walls and there is no alternative path around the box. Without being able to stand below the box, the box cannot be pushed upward onto a goal. Consequently, the puzzle cannot be solved with the given layout.\",\"solution\":[]}"
