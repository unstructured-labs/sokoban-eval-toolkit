The goals are at (2,7), (3,7), (3,9), (4,9), and (4,10). Boxes must be assigned to goals to avoid same-color adjacency: place Orange on (2,7) and (4,10), Emerald on (3,7) and (4,9), and Purple on (3,9). This assignment ensures no same-colored boxes are adjacent on goals, as (2,7) and (3,7) have different colors, and the cluster at (3,9), (4,9), (4,10) has Purple, Emerald, and Orange, with only Emerald and Orange adjacent but different colors.\\n\\nInitial strategy: Start by moving the player to the orange box at (7,7) to free it from its position. Push this box left to (7,6) to create space. Then, move the player to the right to handle the purple and emerald boxes, pushing them towards accessible areas. However, due to wall obstructions, the boxes at (3,13) and (5,13) are difficult to move left to the goals. Prioritize moving boxes that can reach goals, such as the orange at (7,7) to (4,10) and emerald at (7,4) to (4,9), while repositioning the player to enable pushes. The critical moves involve repositioning the player to push boxes without violating adjacency rules.\\n\\nStep-by-step moves:\\n1. Move player to (7,8): From (8,14), move LEFT to (8,13), LEFT to (8,12), UP to (7,12), LEFT to (7,11), LEFT to (7,10), LEFT to (7,9), LEFT to (7,8).\\n2. Push orange box at (7,7) to (7,6): At (7,8), move LEFT to (7,7), pushing box to (7,6).\\n3. Reposition player: From (7,7), move DOWN to (8,7).\\n4.

Similarly, other boxes are moved to their designated goals: Orange boxes to r2c7, r4c7, r6c7 and Sky boxes to r3c7 and r5c7.
